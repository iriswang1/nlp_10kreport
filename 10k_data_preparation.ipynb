BUSINESS  \\n(Dollars in thousands)      \\n**\\n\\n**General**\\n\\nAAR CORP. and its subsidiaries are referred to herein collectively as \"AAR,\" \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" unless the context\\nindicates otherwise. AAR was founded in 1951, organized in 1955 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1966. We are a diversified provider of products and services to the worldwide aviation and government\\nand defense markets. We conduct our business activities primarily through seven principal operating subsidiaries: AAR Parts Trading, Inc.; AAR Aircraft & Engine Sales &\\nLeasing, Inc.; AAR Services, Inc.; AAR Aircraft Services, Inc.; AAR Manufacturing, Inc.; AAR Airlift Group, Inc.; and AAR International, Inc. Our\\ninternational business activities are conducted primarily through AAR International, Inc. \\n\\nWe\\nreport our activities in four business segments: (i) Aviation Supply Chain, comprised primarily of business activities conducted through AAR Parts Trading, Inc.; AAR\\nAllen Services, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAR Services, Inc.); AAR Aircraft & Engine Sales & Leasing, Inc. and AAR International, Inc.;\\n(ii) Government and Defense Services, comprised primarily of business activities conducted through AAR Parts Trading, Inc. and AAR Airlift Group, Inc.; (iii) Maintenance,\\nRepair and Overhaul, comprised primarily of business activities conducted through AAR Services, Inc; AAR Allen Services, Inc. and AAR Aircraft Services, Inc.; and (iv) Structures\\nand Systems, comprised primarily of business activities conducted through AAR Manufacturing, Inc. \\n\\n**Aviation Supply Chain**\\n\\nActivities in our Aviation Supply Chain segment include the purchase, sale, lease, repair and overhaul of a wide variety of new,\\noverhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components and avionics, electrical, electronic, fuel, hydraulic and pneumatic components and instruments for our airline customers. We also\\nprovide customized inventory supply and management programs for engine and airframe parts and components in support of airline customers\\' maintenance activities. The types of services provided under\\nthese programs include material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, and parts and component repair and overhaul. We are an authorized distributor for more than 100\\nleading aviation product manufacturers. On October 11, 2011, we acquired Airinmar Holdings Limited (\"Airinmar\"), a sophisticated repair, outsourcing and warranty claim manager based in the\\nUnited Kingdom. We acquire aviation parts and components from domestic and foreign airlines, original equipment manufacturers, independent aviation service companies and aircraft leasing companies.\\nFrom time to time, we also purchase aircraft and engines for disassembly into individual parts and components. These assets may be leased to airlines on a short-term basis prior to\\ndisassembly. The majority of our sales are made pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders but certain inventory supply and management program agreements reflect negotiated terms and conditions. \\n\\nActivities\\nin our Aviation Supply Chain segment also include the sale and lease of used commercial aircraft. Each sale or lease is negotiated as a separate agreement which includes term,\\nprice, representations, warranties and lease return provisions. Since 2008, our strategy has been to gradually reduce our investment in our joint venture and wholly-owned aircraft portfolio available\\nfor lease or sale to the commercial airline market. At May 31, 2012, the total number of aircraft held in joint ventures was 18 and two were wholly-owned. \\n\\nAs\\nof the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we no longer reported the operating results of our Amsterdam component repair business as a discontinued operation. We made the decision to retain\\nthe operation after considering the results of our sales process and reviewing strategic alternatives for the business. As a result of this change in strategy, the operating results for the Amsterdam\\nbusiness have been reclassified from \\n\\n2\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\ndiscontinued\\noperations and are reported in continuing operations for all periods presented and are not material to our financial position or results of operations. \\n\\n**Government and Defense Services**\\n\\nActivities in our Government and Defense Services segment include the business of AAR Airlift Group, Inc. (\"Airlift\") and our\\nDefense Systems and Logistics and Integrated Technologies services businesses. We acquired Airlift, formerly known as Aviation Worldwide Services, in April 2010. Airlift is a leading provider of\\nexpeditionary airlift services to the United States and other government customers. Airlift provides fixed- and rotary-wing flight operations, transporting personnel and cargo principally\\nin support of the U.S. Department of Defense, and performs engineering and design modifications on rotary-wing aircraft for government customers. Airlift operates a fleet of customized\\nfixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, principally in Afghanistan, Northern Africa and the Western Pacific. Airlift holds FAR Part 133 and 135 certificates to operate\\naircraft and a FAR Part 145 certificate to operate a repair station. Airlift is also Commercial Aircraft Review Board certified with the U.S. Department of Defense. \\n\\nIn\\nthis segment, we also provide customized performance-based logistics programs in support of U.S. Department of Defense and foreign governments. The types of services provided under\\nthese programs include material planning, sourcing, logistics, information and program management, airframe maintenance and maintenance planning and component repair and overhaul. We also provide\\nengineering, design and system integration services for specialized command and control systems. \\n\\n**Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul**\\n\\nActivities in our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (\"MRO\") segment include major airframe maintenance inspection and overhaul, painting\\nservices, line maintenance, airframe modifications, structural repairs, avionic service and installation, exterior and interior refurbishment and engineering services and support for many types of\\ncommercial and military aircraft. We also repair and overhaul landing gears, wheels and brakes for commercial and military aircraft. \\n\\nWe\\ncurrently operate four airframe maintenance facilities and one landing gear overhaul facility. We have a long-term lease to occupy a portion of an aircraft maintenance\\nfacility in Indianapolis, Indiana (the \"Indianapolis Maintenance Center\" or \"IMC\"), which is owned by the Indianapolis Airport Authority (\"IAA\"). The IMC is comprised of 12 airframe maintenance bays,\\nbackshop space and warehouse and office space. Our lease with the IAA allows us to occupy up to ten of the maintenance bays and certain office space through December 2014, with a ten-year\\nrenewal option. We also operate aircraft maintenance facilities in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Miami, Florida and a regional aircraft maintenance facility in Hot Springs, Arkansas. In June 2012, we\\nsigned a lease agreement to occupy an airframe maintenance facility in Duluth, Minnesota. The initial term of the lease agreement is seven years, and we have five, five-year renewal option\\nperiods. We have a termination right, exercisable upon 180 days\\' notice, at any time during the initial seven-year term and option periods. We expect the Duluth facility to operate\\nas a satellite of the IMC. In addition to our aircraft maintenance facilities, we operate a landing gear repair center in Miami, Florida where we repair and overhaul landing gear, wheels, brakes and\\nactuators for different types of commercial and military aircraft. \\n\\nIn\\nthis segment, we purchase replacement parts from OEMs and other suppliers that are used in our maintenance, repair and overhaul operations. We have ongoing arrangements with\\nOEMs that provide us access to parts, repair manuals and service bulletins in support of parts manufactured by the OEMs. Although the terms of each arrangement vary, they typically are\\nmade on standard OEM terms as to duration, price and delivery. When possible, we obtain replacement parts used in repair and overhaul activities from operating units in our Aviation Supply Chain\\nsegment. \\n\\n3\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**Structures and Systems**\\n\\nActivities in our Structures and Systems segment include the design, manufacture and repair of airdrop and other transportation\\npallets, and a wide variety of containers and shelters used in support of military and humanitarian tactical deployment activities. The containers and shelters are used in numerous mission\\nrequirements, including armories, supply and parts storage, refrigeration systems, tactical operation centers, briefing rooms, laundry and kitchen facilities, water treatment and sleeping quarters. \\n\\nIn\\nthis segment, we also design, manufacture and install in-plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military aircraft and helicopters. We are a provider\\nof complex machined and fabricated parts, components and sub-systems for various aerospace and defense programs and other applications, and we design and manufacture advanced composite\\nmaterials for commercial, business and military aircraft. In this segment, sales are made to customers pursuant to standard commercial purchase orders and contracts. We purchase raw materials for this\\nbusiness, including steel, titanium, aluminum, extrusions and castings and other necessary supplies, from a number of vendors. \\n\\nOn\\nDecember 2, 2011, we acquired Telair International GmbH (\"Telair\") and Nordisk Aviation Products, AS (\"Nordisk\"). Telair designs, manufactures and supports cargo loading\\nsystems for wide-body and narrow-body aircraft for both Airbus and Boeing and operates from facilities in Germany, Sweden and Singapore. Nordisk designs and manufactures\\nheavy-duty pallet and lightweight cargo containers for commercial airlines from facilities in Norway and China. \\n\\n**Raw Materials**\\n\\nWe historically have been able to obtain raw materials and other items for our inventories for each of our segments at competitive\\nprices, terms and conditions from numerous sources, and we expect to be able to continue to do so. \\n\\n**Terms of Sale**\\n\\nIn the Aviation Supply Chain, Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul, and Structures and Systems segments, we generally sell our products\\nunder standard 30-day payment terms. On occasion, certain customers (principally foreign customers) will negotiate extended payment terms (60-90 days). Except for\\ncustomary warranty provisions, customers do not have the right to return products nor do they have the right to extended financing. For aircraft sales in Aviation Supply Chain, we sell our products on\\na cash due at delivery basis, standard 30-day payment terms or on an extended payment term basis, and aircraft purchasers do not have the right to return the aircraft. Our contracts with\\nthe U.S. Department of Defense and its contractors, U.S. Department of State and other governmental agencies are typically firm agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price or on a\\ntime and material basis, and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option of the government customer. \\n\\n**Customers**\\n\\nFor each of our business segments, we market and sell products and services primarily through our own employees. In certain markets\\noutside of the United States, we rely on foreign sales agents to assist in the sale of our products and services. \\n\\n4\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nThe principal customers for our products and services in the Aviation Supply Chain and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segments are domestic and foreign\\ncommercial airlines, regional and commuter airlines, business and general aviation operators, original equipment manufacturers, aircraft leasing companies, domestic and foreign military organizations\\nand independent aviation support companies. In the Government and Defense Services segment, our principal customers are the U.S. Department of Defense and its contractors, the U.S. Department of\\nState, and foreign military organizations or governments. In the Structures and Systems segment, our principal customers include the U.S. Department of Defense and its contractors, foreign government\\nand defense organizations, domestic and foreign passenger and freight airlines, original equipment manufacturers, large system providers and other industrial entities. \\n\\nSales\\nof aviation products and services to our airline customers are generally affected by such factors as the number, type and average age of aircraft in service, the levels of aircraft\\nutilization (e.g., frequency of schedules), the number of airline operators, the general economy and the level of sales of new and used aircraft. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S.\\nDepartment of State and other government agencies are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment\\nworldwide, government funding, competitive bidding and requirements generated by world-wide geopolitical events. \\n\\n**Licenses**\\n\\nWe have 11 Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") licensed repair stations in the United States and Europe. Of the 11 licensed FAA\\nrepair stations, six are also European Aviation Safety Agency (\"EASA\") licensed repair stations. Such licenses, which are ongoing in duration, are required in order for us to perform authorized\\nmaintenance, repair and overhaul services for our customers and are subject to revocation by the government for non-compliance with applicable regulations. Of the 11 FAA licensed repair\\nstations, four are in the Aviation Supply Chain segment, one is in the Government and Defense Services segment, five are in the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment and one is in the Structures\\nand Systems segment. Of the six EASA licensed repair stations, two are in the Aviation Supply Chain segment and four are in the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment. In our Government and Defense\\nServices segment, we also hold FAR Part 133 and 135 certificates to operate aircraft. We also are Commercial Aircraft Review Board certified with the U.S. Department of Defense. We believe that\\nwe possess all licenses and certifications that are material to the conduct of our business. \\n\\n**Competition**\\n\\nCompetition in each of our markets is based on quality, ability to provide a broad range of products and services, speed of delivery\\nand price. Competitors in both the Aviation Supply Chain and the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segments include OEMs, the service divisions of large commercial airlines and other independent\\nsuppliers of parts and repair and overhaul services. Our manufacturing, machining and engineering activities in our Structures and Systems segment compete with a number of divisions of large\\ncorporations and other large and small companies. In our Government and Defense Services segment, our expeditionary airlift services activities compete with a few domestic government contracting\\ncompanies and our performance-based logistic services activities compete with large domestic companies and other independent suppliers of these types of services. Although certain of our competitors\\nhave substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, in each of our four business segments we believe that we have maintained a satisfactory competitive position through our\\nresponsiveness to customer needs, our attention to quality and our unique combination of market expertise, and technical and financial capabilities. \\n\\n**Backlog**\\n\\nAt May 31, 2012, backlog believed to be firm was approximately $928,700 compared to $963,100 at May 31, 2011. These\\namounts do not include expected sales from the A400M cargo system (see \\n\\n5\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nItem 1A\\x97Risk\\nFactors). The reduction in backlog from May 31, 2011 is due to lower backlog at the Company\\'s mobility products business unit in the Structures and Systems\\nsegment. Approximately $701,200 of our May 31, 2012 backlog is expected to be filled within the next 12 months. \\n\\n**Employees**\\n\\nAt May 31, 2012, we employed approximately 6,700 persons worldwide, of which 460 employees are subject to a collective\\nbargaining agreement. We also retain approximately 900 contract workers, the majority of whom are located at our airframe maintenance facilities. \\n\\n**Sales to Government and Defense Customers**\\n\\nSales to global government and defense customers were $930,409 (45.1% of total sales), $948,317 (52.5% of total sales) and $651,637\\n(48.2% of total sales) in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $888,489 (43.0% of total sales),\\n$893,066 (49.5% of total sales) and $607,348 (44.9% of total sales) in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Sales to government and defense customers are reported in each of our reportable\\nsegments (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Because such sales are subject to competitive bidding and government funding, no assurance can be given that such sales\\nwill continue at levels previously experienced. The majority of our U.S. government contracts are for products and services supporting U.S. Department of Defense logistics and mobility strategy, as\\nwell as for supplemental airlift services and are, therefore, subject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our government contracts\\nare subject to termination by the customer; in the event of such a termination we would be entitled to recover all allowable costs incurred by us through the date of termination. \\n\\n**Available Information**\\n\\nFor additional information concerning our business segments, see Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\\nCondition and Results of Operations\" and \"Business Segment Information\" in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary\\nData.\" \\n\\nOur\\ninternet address is _www.aarcorp.com_.

RISK FACTORS      \\n**\\n\\nThe following is a description of the principal risks inherent in our business. \\n\\n**_We are affected by factors that adversely impact the commercial aviation industry._**\\n\\nAs a provider of products and services to the commercial aviation industry, we are greatly affected by overall economic conditions of\\nthat industry. The commercial aviation industry is historically cyclical and has been negatively affected in the past by geopolitical events, high oil prices, lack of capital and weak economic\\nconditions. In addition, as a result of these and other events, from time-to-time certain of our customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operation. \\n\\nIn\\ncalendar year 2008 and into 2009, demand for air transportation in the United States and abroad declined due to economic deterioration in the U.S. and other global economies. Although\\nglobal economic conditions improved in the 2010 to 2012 period, the recovery has generally been sluggish in the U.S., and in many other developed nations. The impact of high fuel costs and the\\ncontinued sluggish or weak world-wide economic conditions may lead airlines to reduce domestic or international capacity. In addition, certain of our airline customers have in the past\\nbeen impacted by tight credit markets, which limited their ability to buy parts, services, engines and aircraft. \\n\\nA\\nreduction in the operating fleet of aircraft both in the U.S. and abroad will result in reduced demand for parts support and maintenance activities for the type of aircraft affected.\\nFurther, tight credit conditions negatively impact the amount of liquidity available to buy parts, services, engines and aircraft. A deteriorating airline environment may also result in additional\\nairline bankruptcies, and we may not be able to fully collect outstanding accounts receivable. Reduced demand from customers caused by weak economic conditions, including tight credit conditions and\\ncustomer bankruptcies, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. \\n\\nOur\\nbusiness, financial condition, results of operations and growth rates may be adversely affected by these and other events that impact the aviation industry, including the\\nfollowing:\\n\\n\\x95\\ndeterioration in the financial condition of our existing and potential customers;  \\n\\n\\x95\\nreductions in the need for, or the deferral of, aircraft maintenance and repair services and spare parts support;  \\n\\n\\x95\\nretirement of older generation aircraft, resulting in lower prices for spare parts and services for those aircraft;  \\n\\n\\x95\\nreductions in demand for used aircraft and engines; \\n\\n\\x95\\nincreased in-house maintenance by airlines; \\n\\n\\x95\\nhigh oil prices; \\n\\n\\x95\\nfuture terrorist attacks and the ongoing war on terrorism; \\n\\n\\x95\\nfuture outbreaks of infectious diseases; and \\n\\n\\x95\\nacts of God. \\n\\n**_Our U.S. government contracts may not continue at present sales levels, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations._**\\n\\nOur sales to branches, agencies and departments of the U.S. government and their contractors were $888,489 (43.0% of consolidated\\nsales) in fiscal year 2012 (See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our U.S. government contracts are for products and services supporting U.S. Department of\\nDefense logistics and mobility strategy, as well as for supplemental airlift services and are, \\n\\n7\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\ntherefore,\\nsubject to changes in defense and other governmental agency funding and spending. Our contracts with the U.S. government, including the Department of Defense and its contractors, are\\ntypically agreements to provide products and services at a fixed price and have a term of one year or less, frequently subject to extension for one or more additional periods of one year at the option\\nof the government customer. Sales to agencies of the U.S. government and their contractors are subject to a number of factors, including the level of troop deployment worldwide, competitive bidding,\\nU.S. government funding requirements generated by world events, and budgetary constraints. Defense funding is currently facing pressure due to U.S. budget deficit challenges. In August 2011, Congress\\nenacted the Budget Control Act (\"BCA\") of 2011 which reduces defense spending by $487 billion over a ten-year period starting in fiscal 2012. Under the BCA, an automatic\\nsequestration process was triggered when the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a committee of twelve members of Congress, failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the U.S. federal\\nbudget. The sequestration is scheduled to commence on January 2, 2013, absent legislative or other remedial action. Of the $1.2 trillion in reduced spending required by sequestration over the\\nten-year period beginning in fiscal year 2013, approximately $50 billion per year would be borne by the Department of Defense. Whether or not sequestration goes into effect, we\\nexpect the defense budget to be reduced, which could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_Acquisitions expose us to risks, including the risk that we may be unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses._**\\n\\nWe continue to grow through acquisitions. On December 2, 2011, we acquired Telair and Nordisk from Teleflex International. On\\nOctober 11, 2011, we acquired Airinmar, a sophisticated repair, outsourcing and warranty claim manager based in the UK. We acquired Airlift, formerly known as Aviation Worldwide Services, in\\nApril 2010. Airlift is a leading provider of expeditionary airlift services to the United States and other government customers. Further, we explore and have discussions with third parties regarding\\nadditional acquisitions on a regular basis. Acquisitions involve risks, including difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel, the effects of amortization of any acquired intangible\\nassets and the potential impairment of goodwill, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired business. For our recent acquisitions, and for any businesses we may acquire in the future, we\\nmay not be able to execute our operational, financial or integration plans for the acquired businesses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_We face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts._**\\n\\nWe sell certain of our products and services to our commercial, government and defense customers under firm contracts providing for\\nfixed unit prices, regardless of costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products or providing services may be adversely affected by\\nincreases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, overhead and other unknown variants, including manufacturing and other operational inefficiencies and differences between assumptions used by us to\\nprice a contract and actual results. Increased costs may result in cost overruns and losses on such contracts, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_Significant cost issues may develop in connection with the A400M cargo system._**\\n\\nIn June 2005, we announced that our Cargo Systems business in our Structures and Systems segment was selected to provide cargo handling\\nsystems for the new Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft (\"A400M\"). We have incurred, and are expected to continue to incur, significant development costs in connection with this program (see\\nNote 14 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Our portion of revenue to be generated from this program is expected to exceed $300 million through fiscal 2021, based on current\\nsales projections for the A400M as provided to us by Airbus. Based on program delays and information provided by Airbus, planned first shipments under this program have slipped to late fiscal 2013 or\\nearly fiscal 2014. If the A400M experiences significant additional delivery delays or order cancellations, or if we fail to develop the system according to contract specifications, or if we fail to\\nreach \\n\\n8\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nagreement\\non the final negotiated price with Airbus due to changes in contract specifications, then we may not be able to recover our development costs, and our operating results and financial\\ncondition could be adversely affected. \\n\\n**_Success within our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment is dependent upon continued outsourcing by the airlines._**\\n\\nWe currently perform airframe maintenance, repair and overhaul activities at leased facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana; Oklahoma City,\\nOklahoma; Miami, Florida; and Hot Springs, Arkansas. Revenues at these facilities fluctuate based on demand for maintenance which, in turn, is driven by the number of aircraft operating and the extent\\nof outsourcing of maintenance activities by airlines. If either the number of aircraft operating or the level of outsourcing of maintenance activities declines, we may not be able to execute our\\noperational and financial plans at our maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_We operate in highly competitive markets, and competitive pressures may adversely affect us._**\\n\\nThe markets for our products and services to our commercial, government and defense customers are highly competitive, and we face\\ncompetition from a number of sources, both domestic and international. Our competitors include aircraft and aircraft component and parts manufacturers, airline and aircraft service companies, other\\ncompanies providing maintenance, repair and overhaul services, other aircraft spare parts distributors and redistributors, and other expeditionary airlift service providers. Some of our competitors\\nhave substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and others may price their products and services below our selling prices. These competitive pressures could adversely affect our\\nresults of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_We are subject to significant government regulation and may need to incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation._**\\n\\nThe aviation industry is highly regulated by the FAA in the United States and equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. Before\\nwe sell any of our products that are to be installed in an aircraft, such as engines, engine parts and components, and airframe and accessory parts and components, they must meet certain standards of\\nairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in certain other countries. We operate repair stations that are licensed by the FAA and the equivalent regulatory agencies in\\ncertain other countries, and hold certificates to operate aircraft. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although regulatory requirements in other countries are generally satisfied by\\ncompliance with FAA requirements. New and more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted in the future that, if enacted, may have an adverse impact on us. \\n\\nIf\\nany of our material licenses, certificates, authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended by the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries, our results of\\noperations and financial condition may be adversely affected. \\n\\n**_If we fail to comply with complex procurement laws and regulations, we could lose business and be liable for various penalties or sanctions._**\\n\\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. These\\nlaws and regulations include the Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and laws, regulations and orders restricting the use and dissemination of\\nclassified information under U.S. export control laws, and the export of certain products and technical information. In complying with these laws\\nand regulations, we may incur significant costs, and non-compliance may result in the imposition of fines and penalties, including contractual damages. If we fail to comply with these laws\\nand regulations or if a government audit, review or \\n\\n9\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\ninvestigation\\nuncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions. Our reputation could suffer harm if allegations of impropriety were\\nmade against us, which could adversely affect our operating performance and may result in additional expenses and possible loss of revenue. \\n\\n**_The majority of Airlift\\'s revenue is derived from providing expeditionary airlift services in Afghanistan._**\\n\\nAirlift derives most of its revenue from providing supplemental airlift in Afghanistan for the U.S. Department of Defense. The US and\\nits allies are currently preparing to withdraw the majority of foreign combat troops by the end of calendar 2014. Although we expect significant ongoing demand for airlift services in Afghanistan from\\nthe U.S. Department of Defense and other governmental departments, we are exposed to the risk that our revenues at Airlift may decline, which could adversely affect our results of operations and\\nfinancial condition. We are working to diversify our customer base to help mitigate potential reductions in the U.S. Department of Defense work in Afghanistan. Our inability to diversify our customer\\nbase could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nU.S.\\ngovernment contractors that provide support services in theaters of conflict such as Afghanistan have come under increasing scrutiny by agency inspector generals, government\\nauditors and congressional committees. Investigations pursued by any or all of these groups may result in adverse publicity for us and reputational harm, regardless of the underlying merit of the\\nallegations being investigated. \\n\\n**_We are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally._**\\n\\nWe conduct our business in certain foreign countries, some of which are politically unstable or subject to military or civil conflicts.\\nConsequently, we are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations, including the following:\\n\\n\\x95\\nmilitary conflicts, civil strife and political risks; \\n\\n\\x95\\nexport regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;  \\n\\n\\x95\\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws;  \\n\\n\\x95\\nthe burden and cost of compliance with foreign laws, treaties and technical standards and changes in those regulations;  \\n\\n\\x95\\ncontract award and funding delays; \\n\\n\\x95\\npotential restrictions on transfers of funds; \\n\\n\\x95\\nimport and export duties and value added taxes; \\n\\n\\x95\\nforeign exchange risk; \\n\\n\\x95\\ntransportation delays and interruptions; and \\n\\n\\x95\\nuncertainties arising from foreign local business practices and cultural considerations. \\n\\nWhile\\nwe have and will continue to adopt measures to reduce the potential impact of losses resulting from the risks of doing business internationally, we cannot ensure that such measures\\nwill be adequate. There can be no assurances that the regions in which we operate will continue to be stable enough to allow us to operate profitably or at all. \\n\\n10\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n**_Market values for our aviation products fluctuate, and we may be unable to re-lease or sell aircraft and engines when their current lease expires._**\\n\\nWe use a number of assumptions when determining the recoverability of inventories and aircraft and engines which are on lease or\\navailable for lease. These assumptions include historical sales trends, current and expected usage trends, replacement values, current and expected lease rates, residual values, future demand, and\\nfuture cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we decided to offer one narrow body aircraft for sale from our wholly-owned aircraft portfolio and as a result, we recorded a $5,355\\npre-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the aircraft to its net realizable value. Reductions in demand for our inventories or declining market values, as well as\\ndifferences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the recoverability of our inventories, aircraft and engines, could result in additional impairment charges in\\nfuture periods. \\n\\nWe\\nlease aircraft and engines to our customers on an operating lease basis. Our ability to re-lease or sell these assets on acceptable terms when the lease expires is subject\\nto a number of factors which drive industry capacity, including new aircraft deliveries, availability of used aircraft and engines in the marketplace, competition, financial condition of our\\ncustomers, overall health of the airline industry and general economic conditions. During fiscal 2013, four 737-400 aircraft will be up for lease renewal. Our inability to\\nre-lease these aircraft, or other aircraft and engines that are currently on lease, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_We are dependent upon continued availability of financing to manage our business and to execute our business strategy, and additional financing may not be available on terms\\nacceptable to us._**\\n\\nOur ability to manage our business and to execute our business strategy is dependent, in part, on the continued availability of debt\\nand equity capital. Access to the debt and equity capital markets may be limited by various factors, including the condition of overall credit markets, general economic factors, the state of the\\naviation industry, our financial performance and credit ratings. Debt and equity capital may not continue to be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to obtain financing on\\nfavorable terms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_Our existing debt includes restrictive and financial covenants._**\\n\\nCertain of our loan and debt agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants\\nthat require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan and debt agreements and may result in a cross-default\\nunder other debt agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under our debt agreements could be declared immediately due and\\npayable. Our failure to comply with these covenants could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_Our industry is susceptible to product and other liability claims, and claims not adequately covered by insurance may adversely affect our financial condition._**\\n\\nOur business exposes us to possible claims for property damage and personal injury or death which may result if an engine, engine part\\nor component, airframe part or accessory or any other aviation product which we have sold, manufactured or repaired fails, or if an aircraft we operated, serviced or in which our products are\\ninstalled crashes and the cause cannot be determined. We carry substantial liability insurance in amounts that we believe are adequate for our\\nrisk exposure and commensurate with industry norms. However, claims may arise in the future, and our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us in all circumstances. Additionally, we might\\nnot be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at an acceptable cost. Any liability claim not covered by adequate insurance could adversely affect our results of operations and\\nfinancial condition. \\n\\n11\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**_Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions._**\\n\\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, we face cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and terrorist\\nacts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures, natural disasters, or public health crises. \\n\\nCyber\\nsecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our Company sensitive information, including our\\ncustomers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential\\nor otherwise protected information and corruption of data. \\n\\nAlthough\\nwe utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent\\nsecurity threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified and could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. \\n\\n**_We must comply with extensive environmental requirements, and any exposure to environmental liabilities may adversely affect us._**\\n\\nFederal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge and emission of substances into the environment, the disposal of\\nhazardous wastes, the remediation and abatement of contaminants, and other activities affecting the environment have had and may continue to have an impact on our operations. Management cannot assess\\nthe possible effect of compliance with future environmental requirements or of future environmental claims for which we may not have\\nadequate indemnification or insurance coverage. If we were required to pay the expenses related to any future environmental claims for which neither indemnification nor insurance coverage were\\navailable, these expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\nFuture\\nenvironmental regulatory developments in the United States and abroad concerning issues such as climate change, could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs and,\\nthrough their impact on our customers, reduce demand. Actions may be taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the United States, foreign governments, the International\\nCivil Aviation Organization, or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry. The precise nature of any such\\nrequirements and their applicability to us and our customers are difficult to predict, but the impact to us and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the\\npotential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits. \\n\\n**_We may need to make significant capital expenditures to keep pace with technological developments in our industry._**\\n\\nThe industries in which we participate are constantly undergoing development and change, and it is likely that new products, equipment\\nand methods of repair and overhaul services will be introduced in the future. We may need to make significant expenditures to purchase new equipment and to train our employees to keep pace with any\\nnew technological developments. These expenditures could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n**_Our operations would be adversely affected by a shortage of skilled personnel or work stoppages._**\\n\\nBecause of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce.\\nFurthermore, we have a collective bargaining agreement covering 460 employees. Our ability to operate successfully and meet our customers\\' demands could be jeopardized if we are unable to attract and\\nretain a sufficient number of skilled personnel, including qualified licensed mechanics, to conduct our business, or if we experience a significant or prolonged work stoppage, and may adversely affect\\nour results of operations and financial condition. \\n\\n12\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**ITEM  1B.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \\n(Dollars in thousands)      \\n**\\n\\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\\n\\nManagement\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contain certain statements relating to future\\nresults, which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of management,\\nas well as assumptions and estimates based on information available to us as of the dates such assumptions and estimates are made, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause\\nactual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated, depending on a variety of factors, including those factors discussed under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\" Should one\\nor more of those risks or uncertainties materialize adversely, or should underlying assumptions or estimates prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described. Those events and\\nuncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond our control. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances\\nafter the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. \\n\\n**General Overview**\\n\\nWe report our activities in four business segments: Aviation Supply Chain; Government and Defense Services; Maintenance, Repair and\\nOverhaul; and Structures and Systems. \\n\\nSales\\nin the Aviation Supply Chain segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components principally to\\nthe commercial aviation market. We also offer customized inventory supply chain management programs and aircraft component repair management services. Sales also include the sale and lease of\\ncommercial aircraft and jet engines and technical and advisory services. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor, overhead (primarily indirect labor, facility cost and\\ninsurance) and the cost of lease revenue (primarily depreciation and insurance). \\n\\nSales\\nin the Government and Defense Services segment are derived from the sale of new and overhauled engine and airframe parts and components, customized performance-based logistics\\nprograms, expeditionary airlift services, aircraft modifications and engineering, design, and integration services to our government and defense customers. Cost of sales consists principally of the\\ncost of the product (primarily aircraft and engine parts), direct labor, overhead and aircraft maintenance costs. \\n\\nSales\\nin the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment are principally derived from aircraft maintenance and modifications, engineering services, painting, and the repair, overhaul and\\nexchange of\\nlanding gear. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product (primarily replacement aircraft parts), direct labor and overhead. \\n\\nSales\\nin the Structures and Systems segment are derived from the engineering, design and manufacture of containers, pallets and shelters used to support the U.S. military\\'s requirements\\nfor a mobile and agile force, heavy-duty pallets and lightweight cargo containers for the commercial market, complex machined and fabricated parts, components and sub-systems\\nfor various aerospace and defense programs and other applications, in-plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military applications and composite products for aviation\\nand industrial use. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor and overhead. \\n\\nOur\\nchief operating decision making officer (Chief Executive Officer) evaluates performance based on the reportable segments and utilizes gross profit as a primary profitability measure.\\nThe tables below set \\n\\n17\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nforth\\nconsolidated sales and gross profit for our four business segments for each of the last three fiscal years ended May 31. \\n\\n---  \\n\\n**For the Year Ended May  31, **\\n\\n**2012**\\n\\n**2011**\\n\\n**2010**\\n\\nSales:\\n\\nAviation Supply Chain\\n\\n$\\n588,406\\n\\n$\\n465,108\\n\\n$\\n405,955\\n\\nGovernment and Defense Services\\n\\n552,687\\n\\n571,343\\n\\n194,944\\n\\nMaintenance, Repair and Overhaul\\n\\n422,169\\n\\n393,671\\n\\n301,348\\n\\nStructures and Systems\\n\\n501,736\\n\\n374,990\\n\\n449,904\\n\\n$\\n2,064,998\\n\\n$\\n1,805,112\\n\\n$\\n1,352,151\\n\\n---  \\n\\n**For the Year Ended May  31, **\\n\\n**2012**\\n\\n**2011**\\n\\n**2010**\\n\\nGross Profit:\\n\\nAviation Supply Chain\\n\\n$\\n106,029\\n\\n$\\n76,247\\n\\n$\\n70,490\\n\\nGovernment and Defense Services\\n\\n78,635\\n\\n105,538\\n\\n42,304\\n\\nMaintenance, Repair and Overhaul\\n\\n55,488\\n\\n55,871\\n\\n38,206\\n\\nStructures and Systems\\n\\n78,405\\n\\n69,400\\n\\n92,519\\n\\n$\\n318,557\\n\\n$\\n307,056\\n\\n$\\n243,519\\n\\n**Business Trends and Highlights**\\n\\nOn December 2, 2011, we acquired Telair and Nordisk. Telair designs, manufactures and supports cargo loading systems for\\nwide-body and narrow-body aircraft for both Airbus and Boeing and operates from facilities in Germany, Sweden and Singapore. Nordisk designs and manufactures\\nheavy-duty pallets and lightweight cargo containers for commercial airlines from facilities in Norway and China. Telair and Nordisk are included in the Structures and Systems segment. On\\nOctober 11, 2011, we acquired Airinmar, an international provider of aircraft component repair management services which is based in the UK. Airinmar operates as part of our Aviation Supply\\nChain segment. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2012, sales to commercial customers increased 32.4% compared to the prior year and represented 54.9% of consolidated sales. Commercial sales growth during fiscal 2012 was\\ndriven by strong organic growth in the Aviation Supply Chain and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul businesses and by the Telair and Nordisk acquisitions. Commercial sales growth during fiscal 2012\\noccurred against a backdrop of global economic uncertainty, including persistently high oil prices, recent bankruptcies in the aviation industry and the debt crisis in Europe. We continue to monitor\\nthese events and their potential impact on our commercial customers. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2012, sales to global government and defense customers decreased 1.9% compared to the prior year and represented 45.1% of consolidated sales. Defense funding is currently\\nfacing pressure due to U.S. budget deficit challenges. In August 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act (\"BCA\") of 2011 which reduces defense spending by $487 billion over a\\nten-year period starting in fiscal 2012. Under the BCA, an automatic sequestration process was triggered when the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a committee of twelve members\\nof Congress, failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the U.S. federal budget. The sequestration is scheduled to commence on January 2, 2013, absent legislative or other remedial action.\\nOf the $1.2 trillion in reduced spending required by sequestration over the ten-year period beginning in fiscal year 2013, approximately $50 billion per year would be borne by the\\nDepartment of Defense. Whether or not sequestration goes into effect, we expect the defense budget will be reduced. Although there may be additional opportunities for those business units within our\\nSupply Chain and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segments that support the Department of Defense, as a \\n\\n18\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nresult\\nof defense spending reductions, we expect our businesses that support the Department of Defense within our Structures and Systems segment will be adversely affected. \\n\\n**Outlook for Fiscal 2013**\\n\\nFor fiscal 2013, we expect our commercial aviation results to remain strong and to increase on a year-over-year\\nbasis as the full-year impact of Telair and Nordisk\\'s operations are included in results. We also expect improved results at AAR Airlift as it benefits from actions taken to improve\\naircraft availability and reduce costs. Results at our mobility products and defense systems logistics businesses are expected to be down year-over-year. As a result, we expect\\nfiscal 2013 consolidated sales of approximately $2.1 to $2.2 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.65. \\n\\n**Results of Operations**\\n\\n**Fiscal 2012 Compared with Fiscal 2011**\\n\\nConsolidated sales for fiscal 2012 increased $259,886 or 14.4% compared to the prior year period. Sales to commercial customers\\nincreased 32.4% compared to the prior year and included strong organic growth in our Aviation Supply Chain and Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segments, as well as sales from the newly acquired\\nbusinesses, Telair and Nordisk. Sales to government and defense customers decreased 1.9% principally due to lower sales at our defense logistics business. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Aviation Supply Chain segment, sales increased $123,298 or 26.5% compared to the prior year due to strength at our parts supply businesses, which benefited from the improved\\ncommercial airline environment and the recent investments of assets, the sale of four aircraft for approximately $49,000 from our aircraft sales and leasing portfolio and the addition of Airimar sales\\nof $26,058. Gross profit in the Aviation Supply Chain segment increased $29,782 or 39.1% and the gross profit margin percentage increased to 18.0% from 16.4% in the prior year primarily due to the mix\\nof products sold. The prior year gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by a $5,355 pre-tax impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 to reduce the carrying\\nvalue of an aircraft held for sale to its estimated sales price. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Government and Defense Services (\"GDS\") segment, sales decreased $18,656 or 3.3% compared to the prior year. The sales decrease primarily reflects the decline in the defense\\nlogistics business\\nincluding the fourth quarter fiscal 2012 adjustment to the KC10 support contract. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we recorded a $9,500 pre-tax charge as a result of lowering our profit\\nexpectations on the KC10 support contract. This adjustment represents the difference between the new margin expectation and the previous margin expectation for the period of performance since contract\\ninception, which was February 2010. GDS gross profit decreased $26,903 or 25.5% and the gross profit margin percentage declined to 14.2% from 18.5% in the prior year. The decline in gross profit was\\ndue to decreased Airlift margins as a result of unfavorable aircraft availability in the last half of fiscal 2012 and the impact of the KC10 support contract adjustment. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment, sales increased $28,498 or 7.2% versus the prior year due to continued growth and share gains at our heavy maintenance facilities,\\npartially offset by lower sales at our engineering services business. Gross profit decreased $383 or 0.7% and the gross profit margin percentage decreased to 13.1% from 14.2% due to lower sales in\\nfiscal 2012 of high margin engineering services. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Structures and Systems segment, sales increased $126,746 or 33.8% compared to the prior year due to the inclusion of sales from Telair and Nordisk, which contributed $119,429 of\\nrevenue during fiscal 2012. Gross profit in the Structures and Systems segment increased $9,005 or 13.0%; however the gross profit margin percentage decreased to 15.6% from 18.5% in the prior year.\\nFactors impacting the decline in margin percentage include the mix of products sold, losses on certain programs and start-up costs on \\n\\n19\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nnew\\nprograms at our precision machining business, and the restructuring and impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 of $3,700 (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements). \\n\\nDuring\\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold the assets of a non-strategic product line within our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment. Proceeds from the sale of\\nthe product line were $10,000 cash, and the net carrying value of the assets sold was $4,078. The gain on this transaction has been classified as a component of operating income. \\n\\nSelling,\\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased $6,703 or 3.7% due to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses for the three acquired companies. Earnings from\\naircraft joint ventures decreased $1,802 compared to the prior year due to the sale of two aircraft from our joint venture aircraft portfolio during the prior year. Operating income decreased $2,926\\nor 2.2% compared with the prior year primarily due to lower gross profit in the Government and Defense Services segment and increased selling general and administrative expenses, partially offset by\\nincreased gross profit in the Aviation Supply Chain and Structures and Systems segment. Net interest expense\\nincreased $6,211 or 20.5% compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in outstanding borrowings incurred for the purchase of Telair and Nordisk. \\n\\nOur\\neffective income tax rate was 27.2% in fiscal 2012 compared to 32.5% in fiscal 2011. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a $3,300 reduction in income tax expense\\nprimarily relating to revisions in book versus tax differences. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded a $3,976 reduction in income tax expense primarily relating to a reduction in our\\nstate income tax rate due to the implementation of state income tax planning strategies related to our corporate structure and the relocation of one of our significant businesses. During the fourth\\nquarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a net $2,300 tax benefit, which was primarily the result of a $3,531 federal income tax benefit as a result of the completion of an examination of our income tax\\nreturns from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2012, we retired $9,421 principal amount of our 1.625% convertible notes resulting in a net loss of $161. We also retired $20,551 principal amount of our 1.75% convertible\\nnotes resulting in a net loss of $191. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we retired $9,100 and $6,000 principal amount of our 2.25% convertible notes resulting in a net loss of $312 and a gain of $97 for\\nyears 2012 and 2011, respectively. \\n\\nNet\\nincome attributable to AAR was $67,723 compared to $69,826 in the prior year due to the factors discussed above. \\n\\n**Fiscal 2011 Compared with Fiscal 2010**\\n\\nConsolidated sales for fiscal 2011 increased $452,961 or 33.5% compared to the prior year period. Sales to commercial customers\\nincreased 22.3% compared to the prior year due to increased demand for supply chain and MRO and engineering services, reflecting improved conditions in the commercial aviation industry and performance\\non new contract awards. Sales to government and defense customers increased 45.5% principally due to the inclusion of Airlift, and increased sales at our defense logistics business. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Aviation Supply Chain segment, sales increased $59,153 or 14.6% compared to the prior year. Our parts supply businesses benefitted from the improved airline environment as\\nmaintenance activity increased and airlines restocked inventory levels. Gross profit in the Aviation Supply Chain segment increased $5,757 or 8.2% and the gross profit margin percentage declined to\\n16.4% from 17.4% in the prior year primarily due to the mix of products sold. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we recorded a $5,355 pre-tax impairment charge to reduce the\\ncarrying value of an aircraft held for sale to its estimated sales price. Prior year gross profit was negatively impacted by the sale of the interest in a leveraged lease, in which we recorded a\\n$3,800 negative gross profit margin. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Government and Defense Services segment, sales increased $376,399 or 193.1% compared to fiscal 2010. The sales increase reflects the inclusion of revenue from Airlift, which\\ncontributed \\n\\n20\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\napproximately\\n$281,000 of revenue during fiscal 2011, as well as growth in our defense logistics business due to the ramp-up of a new performance-based logistics program. Gross profit\\nincreased $63,234 or 149.5% due to increased sales; however, gross profit margin percentage declined to 18.5% from 21.7% in the prior year reflecting lower margins in the defense logistics business\\ndue to transition costs associated with the new performance-based logistics program, and a contract adjustment which lowered the pricing for services we deliver under another supply chain program. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment, sales increased $92,323 or 30.6% versus the prior year due to strong growth at our heavy maintenance and landing gear facilities as well\\nas in our engineering services business. The strong growth was driven by performance on contract awards announced in the previous twelve month period, and the improved airline environment. Gross\\nprofit increased $17,665 or 46.2% and the gross profit margin percentage increased to 14.2% from 12.7% in the prior year primarily due to increased volume at each of our MRO facilities. \\n\\nIn\\nthe Structures and Systems segment, sales decreased $74,914 or 16.7% compared to the prior year due to the expected decline in volume at our mobility products business as that\\nbusiness completed contract requirements on two large contracts in fiscal 2010. Gross profit in the Structures and Systems segment decreased $23,119 or 25.0% and the gross profit margin percentage\\ndecreased to 18.5% from 20.6% in the prior year due to the mix of products sold and lower volume. \\n\\nDuring\\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold the assets of a non-strategic product line within our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment. Proceeds from the sale of\\nthe product line were $10,000 cash, and the net carrying value of the assets sold was $4,078. The gain on this transaction has been classified as a component of operating income. \\n\\nSelling,\\ngeneral and administrative expenses increased $29,395 or 19.2% primarily due to the inclusion of selling, general and administrative expenses of Airlift. Earnings from aircraft\\njoint ventures increased $3,232 compared to the prior year due to the sale of two aircraft from our joint venture aircraft portfolio during fiscal 2011. Operating income increased $43,296 or 47.9%\\ncompared with the prior year primarily due to the increase in sales, partially offset by the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Net interest expense increased $4,431 or 17.1%\\ncompared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in outstanding borrowings. Our effective income tax rate was 32.5% in fiscal 2011 compared to 32.7% in fiscal 2010. During the fourth quarter of\\nfiscal 2011, we recorded a net $2,300 tax benefit, which was primarily the result of a $3,531 federal income tax benefit as a result\\nof the completion of an examination of our income tax returns from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009. The fiscal 2010 effective tax rate reflects the favorable tax impact from the sale of an interest in\\nan aircraft leveraged lease. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2011, we retired $6,000 principal amount of our 2.25% convertible notes resulting in a net gain on extinguishment of debt of $97. \\n\\nIn\\nJune 2010, we and partners of AAR Global Solutions, LLC (\"AAR GS\") agreed to wind down the operations of AAR GS, resulting in $0 reported in loss attributable to noncontrolling\\ninterest in fiscal 2011. \\n\\nNet\\nincome attributable to AAR was $69,826 compared to $44,628 in the prior year due to the factors discussed above. \\n\\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\\n\\nHistorically, we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through the generation of cash from operations, augmented\\nby the periodic issuance of common stock and debt in the public and private markets. In addition to these cash sources, our current capital resources include an unsecured credit facility, as well as a\\nseparate secured credit facility. We continually evaluate various financing arrangements, including the issuance of common stock or debt, which would allow us to improve our liquidity position and\\nfinance future growth on commercially reasonable terms. Our continuing ability to borrow from our lenders and issue debt and equity securities to the public and private markets in the \\n\\n21\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nfuture\\nmay be negatively affected by a number of factors, including the overall health of the credit markets, general economic conditions, airline industry conditions, geo-political\\nevents, and our operating performance. Our ability to generate cash from operations is influenced primarily by our operating performance and changes in working capital. Under a universal shelf\\nregistration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that became effective on May 4, 2012, we registered an indeterminate number or principal amount of shares of common\\nstock, shares of preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units which may be sold from time to time, subject to market conditions. \\n\\nAt\\nMay 31, 2012, our liquidity and capital resources included cash of $67,720 and working capital of $590,046. During fiscal 2012, we acquired three companies for a total cash\\noutlay of $298,087. In addition, we also invested in our business through capital additions of $91,218. In order to fund these transactions, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility and\\nborrowings thereunder, completed an offering for $175,000 in 7.25% Senior Notes in a private placement, and entered into a five year full amortization term loan agreement with Development Bank of\\nJapan Inc. for $50,000. These items are described further below. \\n\\nOn\\nApril 12, 2011, we entered into an agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders (as amended, the\\n\"Credit Agreement\") providing for an unsecured revolving credit facility that we can draw upon for general corporate purposes. The revolving commitment was originally $400,000 and on\\nOctober 13, 2011 was increased to $580,000. Under certain circumstances, we may request an increase to the revolving commitment by an aggregate amount of up to $100,000, not to exceed $680,000\\nin total. The Credit Agreement expires on April 12, 2016. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate (defined as the British Bankers Association LIBOR\\nRate) plus 125 to 225 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Eurodollar Rate loan, or at the offered fluctuating Base Rate plus 25 to 125 basis points based on certain financial\\nmeasurements if a Base Rate loan. \\n\\nThe\\nCredit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum tangible net worth. The Credit\\nAgreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including those relating to financial reporting and notification, payment of indebtedness, taxes and other obligations, compliance with\\napplicable laws, and limitations on additional liens, indebtedness, acquisitions, investments and disposition of assets. The Credit Agreement also requires our significant domestic subsidiaries, and\\nany subsidiaries that guarantee our other indebtedness, to provide a guarantee of payment under the Credit Agreement. \\n\\nBorrowings\\noutstanding under this facility at May 31, 2012 were $280,000 and there were approximately $14,329 of outstanding letters of credit which reduced the availability of\\nthis facility to $285,671 at May 31, 2012. There are no other terms or covenants limiting the availability of this facility. We also have $4,370 available under a foreign line of credit. \\n\\nOn\\nJanuary 23, 2012 we completed an offering of $175,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the \"Notes\"). The Notes were sold to qualified institutional\\nbuyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in accordance with\\nRegulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes were sold at a price equal to 98.268% of the principal amount thereof, for a yield to maturity of 7.5%. The net proceeds of the offering of the\\nNotes were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our revolving credit agreement incurred to fund our December 2011 acquisition of Telair and Nordisk. \\n\\nThe\\nNotes are governed by an Indenture dated as of January 23, 2012 (the \"Indenture\") by and among AAR, certain subsidiary guarantors identified therein (the \"Guarantors\") and\\nU.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. \\n\\n22\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nThe\\nNotes bear interest at a rate of 7.25% per year, payable semi-annually, in cash in arrears, on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing\\nJuly 15, 2012. The Notes will mature on January 15, 2022. Prior to January 15, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash\\nproceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 107.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date. At any\\ntime prior to January 15, 2017, we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus a make-whole\\npremium, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date. We may redeem the Notes at our option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after\\nJanuary 15, 2017, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days\\' notice at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount to be redeemed) set forth below, plus any\\naccrued and unpaid interest and additional interest, if any, to the redemption date if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on January 15 of the years indicated below: \\n\\n---  \\n\\n**Year\\n\\n**\\n\\n**Redemption Price**\\n\\n2017\\n\\n103.625\\n%\\n\\n2018\\n\\n102.417\\n%\\n\\n2019\\n\\n101.208\\n%\\n\\n2020 and thereafter\\n\\n100.000\\n%\\n\\nThe\\nNotes are unconditionally guaranteed, on a full, joint and several basis, by each of the Guarantors, which consist of all of our existing domestic subsidiaries. The Notes and the\\nguarantees are general unsecured senior obligations of AAR and the Guarantors, respectively, rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior debt of AAR and the Guarantors, as\\napplicable, and are senior in right of payment to all future subordinated obligations of AAR or the Guarantors. The Notes and the guarantees are effectively subordinated to secured debt of AAR and the\\nGuarantors, respectively, to the extent of the value of the assets securing that debt. In addition, the Notes are structurally junior to any debt or other liabilities of our nonguarantor subsidiaries. \\n\\nThe\\nIndenture contains covenants that, amount other things, limit AAR\\'s and its Restricted Subsidiaries\\' (as defined in the Indenture) abilities to (i) incur additional debt or\\nsell preferred stock, (ii) pay dividends, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions, (iii) make certain investments, (iv) make other restricted payments and\\ninvestments, (v) agree to or allow to exist restrictions on the ability to pay dividends or make other payments on its capital interests, (vi) create liens without granting equal and\\nratable liens to the holders of the Notes, (vii) enter into sale and leaseback transactions, (viii) merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of their assets,\\n(ix) enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates and (x) sell assets. These covenants are subject to a number of qualifications and limitations. In addition, the Indenture\\nlimits AAR\\'s and the Restricted Subsidiaries\\' abilities to engage in businesses other than businesses in which such companies are engaged on the date of issuance of the Notes and related businesses. \\n\\nOn\\nMarch 9, 2012, we entered into a five year full amortization term loan agreement with Development Bank of Japan Inc. (the \"Loan Agreement\") to refinance a portion of the\\nindebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of Telair and Nordisk. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bear interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate (defined as the British Bankers Association\\nLIBOR Rate) plus 250 basis points and are unsecured. As of May 31, 2012, $50,000 was outstanding under this agreement and there is no additional amount available. There are no other terms or\\ncovenants limiting the availability of this facility. \\n\\n23\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nThe Loan Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants which are consistent with our Credit Agreement. The Loan Agreement is not guaranteed by\\nany of our subsidiaries. The Loan Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including those relating to financial reporting and notification, payment of indebtedness, taxes\\nand other obligations, compliance with applicable laws, and limitations on additional liens, indebtedness, acquisitions, investments and disposition of assets. In addition to our unsecured Credit\\nAgreement and the Loan Agreement, we have a $65,000 secured revolving credit facility with The Huntington National Bank (the \"Huntington Loan Agreement\"). Borrowings under the Huntington Loan\\nAgreement are secured by aircraft and related engines and components owned by us. The Huntington Loan Agreement expires on April 23, 2015. Borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus 325 basis\\npoints. As of May 31, 2012, $33,022 was outstanding under this agreement resulting in $31,978 remaining available. There are no other terms or covenants limiting the availability of this\\nfacility. \\n\\nWe\\nare in compliance with all financial covenants under each of our financing arrangements. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2012, cash flow from operations was $94,217 primarily as a result of net income attributable to AAR and noncontrolling interest and aggregate depreciation and amortization\\nof $174,079. The positive impact on cash from our earnings and aggregate depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes and the change in accounts payable, accounts receivable and equipment on\\nlong-term lease was partially offset by increases in inventories primarily to support aviation supply chain customers and program costs for the A400M program. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2012, our investing activities used $390,225 of cash principally as a result of investments in companies acquired of $298,087 and capital expenditures of $91,218 which\\nprimarily represents rotary and fixed-wing aircraft and other equipment purchased to support growth and improve operating performance in our Government and Defense Services segment. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2012, our financing activities provided $306,843 of cash primarily due to net proceeds from borrowings of $410,264 partially offset by the payment of dividends of $12,081.\\nAs noted above, we completed an offering for $175,000 in 7.25% Senior Notes in a private placement, entered into a five year full amortization term loan agreement with Development Bank of\\nJapan Inc. for $50,000 and increased the borrowings on our revolver by $180,000. \\n\\n24\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**\\n\\nA summary of contractual cash obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements as of May 31, 2012 is as follows: \\n\\n---  \\n\\n**Payments Due by Period**\\n\\n**Total**\\n\\n**Due in  \\n\\nFiscal  \\n\\n2013 **\\n\\n**Due in  \\n\\nFiscal  \\n\\n2014 **\\n\\n**Due in  \\n\\nFiscal  \\n\\n2015 **\\n\\n**Due in  \\n\\nFiscal  \\n\\n2016 **\\n\\n**Due in  \\n\\nFiscal  \\n\\n2017 **\\n\\n**After  \\n\\nFiscal  \\n\\n2017 **\\n\\nOn Balance Sheet:\\n\\nDebt\\n\\n$\\n451,277\\n1\\n$\\n108,949\\n\\n$\\n76,003\\n\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\n$\\n66,325\\n\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\n$\\n200,000\\n\\nCapital Leases\\n\\n170\\n\\n85\\n\\n85\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\nBank Borrowings\\n\\n363,650\\n2\\n\\n18,087\\n\\n22,781\\n\\n22,782\\n\\n290,000\\n\\n10,000\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\nInterest\\n\\n48,931\\n3\\n\\n27,281\\n\\n6,813\\n\\n5,396\\n\\n4,885\\n\\n2,249\\n\\n2,307\\n\\nOff Balance Sheet:\\n\\nFacilities and Equipment Operating Leases\\n\\n137,699\\n\\n28,155\\n\\n23,449\\n\\n18,789\\n\\n11,588\\n\\n9,423\\n\\n46,295\\n\\nGarden City, New York Operating Lease\\n\\n21,442\\n\\n1,647\\n\\n1,688\\n\\n1,730\\n\\n1,773\\n\\n1,817\\n\\n12,787\\n\\nPurchase Obligations\\n\\n259,101\\n\\n250,458\\n\\n8,034\\n\\n412\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n197\\n\\nPension Contribution\\n\\n6,500\\n\\n6,500\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNotes: \\n\\n1\\n$99,170\\npar value of our long-term debt is due February 1, 2026; however, we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the\\nnotes at any time on or after February 6, 2013. Holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase all or a portion of notes on February 1, 2013, 2016 and 2021. We have\\nincluded the outstanding amount for these notes in the due in fiscal 2013 column. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\n2\\nThe\\nterm of our revolving credit agreement extends to April 12, 2016.\\n\\n3\\nInterest\\nassociated with variable rate debt was determined using the interest rate in effect on May 31, 2012. \\n\\nPurchase\\nobligations arise in the ordinary course of business and represent a binding commitment to acquire inventory, including raw materials, parts and components, as well as equipment\\nto support the operations of our business. We routinely issue letters of credit and performance bonds in the ordinary course of business. These instruments are typically issued in conjunction with\\ninsurance contracts or other business requirements. The total of these instruments outstanding at May 31, 2012 was $16,798. \\n\\n**Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates**\\n\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\\nManagement has made estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The\\nmost significant estimates made by management include those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts, assumptions used in assessing goodwill impairment, adjustments to reduce the value of\\ninventories and aviation equipment on or available for lease, revenue recognition, loss accruals for aviation equipment operating leases, program development costs and assumptions used in determining\\npension plan obligations. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those estimates. The following is a summary of the accounting policies considered critical by management. \\n\\n25\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n_Allowance for Doubtful Accounts_\\n\\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce the value of customer accounts receivable to amounts expected to be\\ncollected. In determining the required allowance, we consider factors such as general and industry-specific economic conditions, customer credit history, and our customer\\'s current and expected future\\nfinancial performance. \\n\\n_Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets_\\n\\nUnder accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite\\nlives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests. We review and evaluate our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for potential impairment at a minimum annually, on\\nMay 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We use a two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we compare the\\nfair value of each reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a valuation technique based on a multiple\\nof earnings or discounted cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we would be required to complete a second step to\\ndetermine the amount of goodwill impairment. In the second step, we would determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit\\'s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit\\'s fair value to all of the\\nassets and liabilities other than goodwill. We then would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount and recognize the difference as an impairment charge. \\n\\nThe\\nassumptions we used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units are based on historical performance as well as forecasts used in our current business plan. \\n\\nThe\\namount reported under the caption \"Goodwill and other intangible assets, net\" is comprised of goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquisitions we made, principally since\\nthe beginning of fiscal 1998. \\n\\n_Inventories_\\n\\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the specific identification, average cost or\\nfirst-in, first-out methods. Provisions are made for excess and obsolete inventories and inventories that have been impaired as a result of industry conditions. We have\\nutilized certain assumptions when determining the market value of inventories, such as historical sales of inventory, current and expected future aviation usage trends, replacement values and expected\\nfuture demand. Reductions in demand for certain of our inventories or declining market values, as well as differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized by us when determining the\\nmarket value of our inventories, could result in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods. \\n\\n_Revenue Recognition_\\n\\nCertain supply chain management programs that we provide to our customers contain multiple elements or deliverables, such as program\\nand warehouse management, parts distribution and maintenance and repair services. We recognize revenue for each element or deliverable that can be identified as a separate unit of accounting at the\\ntime of delivery based upon the relative fair value of the products and services. \\n\\nSales\\nand related cost of sales for certain long-term manufacturing contracts and certain large airframe maintenance contracts and performance-based logistics programs are\\nrecognized by the percentage of completion method, either based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs or the units of delivery method. In connection with these\\ncontracts and programs, we are required to make certain judgments and estimates concerning the overall profitability of the program and \\n\\n26\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nthe\\nrelative fair value of each element of the arrangement. Differences may occur between the judgments and estimates made by management and actual program results. \\n\\n_Equipment on or Available for Lease_\\n\\nThe cost of assets under lease is original purchase price plus overhaul costs. Depreciation is computed using the\\nstraight-line method over the estimated service life of the equipment, and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. \\n\\nWe\\nare required to test for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from\\nits undiscounted cash flows. When applying accounting standards addressing impairment to equipment on or available for lease, we have utilized certain assumptions to estimate future undiscounted cash\\nflows, including current and future lease rates, lease terms, residual values and market conditions and trends impacting future demand. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized\\nby us when determining undiscounted cash flows could result in future impairments of aircraft and engines which are currently being leased or are available for lease. During the fourth quarter of\\nfiscal 2011, we recorded a $5,355\\npre-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of an aircraft held for sale to its fair value (See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). \\n\\n_Program Development Costs_\\n\\nIn June 2005, we announced that our Cargo Systems business was selected to provide cargo handling systems for the new Airbus A400M\\nMilitary Transport Aircraft (\"A400M\"). Our portion of the revenue from this program is expected to exceed $300,000 through fiscal 2021, based on sales projections of the A400M. As of May 31,\\n2012, we have capitalized, net of reimbursements, $91,942 of costs associated with the engineering and development of the cargo system. In May 2012, we received $15,000 cash as reimbursement for\\ncertain program development costs. We have the opportunity to receive additional milestone payments which are tied to deliveries from us through December 31, 2012. The $91,942 is net of the\\n$15,000 cash payment received in May. Sales and related cost of sales will be recognized on the units of delivery method. In determining the recoverability of the capitalized program development\\ncosts, we have utilized certain judgments and estimates concerning expected revenues and the cost to manufacture the A400M cargo system. Differences between actual results and the assumptions utilized\\nby us may result in us not fully recovering the value of the program development costs, which would unfavorably impact our financial condition and results of operations. \\n\\n_Pension Plans_\\n\\nThe liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension plans are determined utilizing several actuarial assumptions, the most significant\\nof which are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. \\n\\nOur\\ndiscount rate is determined based on a review of long-term, high quality corporate bonds as of May 31, 2012, and models that match projected benefit payments to\\ncoupons and maturities from the high quality bonds. The assumption for the expected long-term return on plan assets is developed through analysis of historical asset returns by investment\\ncategory, our fund\\'s actual return experience and current market conditions. Changes in the discount rate and differences between expected and actual return on plan assets may impact the amount of net\\nperiodic pension expense recognized in our consolidated statement of income. \\n\\n_New Accounting Standards_\\n\\nIn June 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to provide guidance on increasing the prominence of items reported in other\\ncomprehensive income. This accounting standard update eliminates \\n\\n27\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nthe\\noption to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires that the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components\\nof other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This accounting standard update is effective\\nfor us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and it will result in changes in our financial statement presentation. \\n\\nIn\\nAugust 2011, the FASB approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment. The amendment will allow an entity to first\\nassess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair\\nvalue of a reporting unit unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. This accounting\\nstandard update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, and early adoption is permitted. \\n\\n28\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  \\n(Dollars in thousands)      \\n**\\n\\nOur exposure to market risk includes fluctuating interest rates under our credit agreements, changes in foreign exchange rates and\\ncredit losses on accounts receivable. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on accounts receivable exposure. \\n\\nAt\\nMay 31, 2012, $285,671 was available under our unsecured Credit Agreement. Interest on amounts borrowed under this credit facility is LIBOR based. As of May 31, 2012,\\nthe outstanding balance under this agreement was $280,000. A hypothetical 10 percent increase to the average interest rate under the credit facilities applied to the average outstanding balance\\nduring fiscal 2012 would have reduced our pre-tax income by approximately $548 during fiscal 2012. \\n\\nWe\\nuse derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we entered into two\\nderivative financial instruments in order to manage our variable interest exposure over a medium- to long-term period. Our derivative instruments are classified as cash flow hedges. We\\nrecognize the gains and losses on our derivative instruments as an adjustment to interest expense in the period the hedged interest payment affects earnings. \\n\\nIn\\nJune 2011, we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional amount of $50,000 that effectively converted $50,000 of notional principal under\\nthe unsecured Credit Agreement from floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt. At May 31, 2012, we were in a liability position for this interest rate swap, the fair value\\nof which was $4,479. \\n\\nAlso\\nin June 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement for the purpose of limiting future exposure to interest rate risk on $50,000 of notional principal outstanding under the\\nunsecured Credit Agreement. Under this agreement, we made a premium payment totaling $1,750 to cap the interest rate for the five-year term of the agreement. At May 31, 2012, the\\ninterest rate cap had a fair value of $249. \\n\\nRevenues\\nand expenses of our foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the year, and balance sheet accounts are translated at year-end exchange\\nrates. Balance sheet translation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders\\' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. A hypothetical\\n10 percent devaluation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would decrease pre-tax income by $2,740 for 2012. \\n\\n29\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n**ITEM 8.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\\n\\n_Description of Business_\\n\\nAAR CORP. is a diversified provider of products and services to the worldwide aviation and government and defense markets. Products and\\nservices include: aviation supply chain and parts support programs; maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft and landing gear; design and manufacture of specialized mobility and cargo systems and\\ncomposite and other high-end precision machined structures; expeditionary airlift services; aircraft modifications and aircraft sales and leasing. We serve commercial, defense and\\ngovernmental aircraft fleet operators, original equipment manufacturers, and independent service providers around the world, and various other domestic and foreign military customers. \\n\\n_Principles of Consolidation_\\n\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries after\\nelimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in other companies in which we have significant influence; generally this represents\\ncommon stock ownership of at least 20% and not more than 50% (see Note 9 for a discussion of aircraft joint ventures). \\n\\nAs\\nof the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we no longer reported the operating results of our Amsterdam component repair business as a discontinued operation. We made the decision to retain\\nthe operation\\nafter considering the results of our sales process and reviewing strategic alternatives for the business. As a result of this change in strategy, the operating results for the Amsterdam business have\\nbeen reclassified from discontinued operations and are reported in continuing operations for all periods presented and are not material to our financial position or results of operations. \\n\\n_Revenue Recognition_\\n\\nSales and related cost of sales for product sales are recognized upon shipment of the product to the customer. Our standard terms and\\nconditions provide that title passes to the customer when the product is shipped to the customer. Sales of certain defense products are recognized upon customer acceptance, which includes transfer of\\ntitle. Under the majority of our expeditionary airlift services contracts, we are paid and record as revenue a fixed daily amount per aircraft for each day an aircraft is available to perform airlift\\nservices. In addition, we are paid and record as revenue an amount which is based on number of hours flown. Sales from services and the related cost of services are generally recognized when\\ncustomer-owned material is shipped back to the customer. We have adopted this accounting policy because at the time the customer-owned material is shipped back to the customer, all services related to\\nthat material are complete as our service agreements generally do not require us to provide services at customer sites. Furthermore, serviced units are typically shipped to the customer immediately\\nupon completion of the related services. Sales and related cost of sales for certain long-term manufacturing contracts and certain large airframe maintenance contracts and\\nperformance-based logistics programs are recognized by the percentage of completion method, either based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs or the units of delivery\\nmethod. Lease revenues are recognized as earned. Income from monthly or quarterly rental payments is recorded in the pertinent period according to the lease agreement. However, for leases that provide\\nvariable rents, we recognize lease income on a straight-line basis. In addition to a monthly lease rate, some engine leases require an additional rental amount based on the number of hours\\nthe engine is used in a particular month. Lease income associated with these contingent \\n\\n36\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES**\\n\\n**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)**\\n\\n**(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)**\\n\\n**1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**\\n\\nrentals\\nis recorded in the period in which actual usage is reported to us by the lessee, which is normally the month following the actual usage. \\n\\nCertain\\nsupply chain management programs we provide our customers contain multiple elements or deliverables, such as program and warehouse management, parts distribution and maintenance\\nand repair services. We recognize revenue for each element or deliverable that can be identified as a separate unit of accounting at the time of delivery based upon the relative fair value of the\\nproducts and services. \\n\\nIncluded\\nin accounts receivable as of May 31, 2012 and 2011, are $36,218 and $28,867, respectively, of unbilled accounts receivable related to a defense supply chain support\\nagreement. These unbilled accounts receivable relate to costs we have incurred on parts that were requested and accepted by our customer to support the program. These costs have not been billed by us\\nbecause the customer has not issued the final paperwork necessary to allow for billing. \\n\\nIn\\naddition to the unbilled accounts receivable, included in _Other_ on the consolidated balance sheet as of May  31, 2012 and 2011,\\nare $27,872 and $19,404, respectively, of costs in excess of amounts billed for the same defense supply chain support agreement. We expect to recover costs in excess of amounts billed through future\\nbillings over the life of the program. \\n\\n_Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets_\\n\\nUnder accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite\\nlives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment tests. We review and evaluate our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for potential impairment at a minimum annually, on\\nMay 31, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment is possible. We use a two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment. In the first step, we compare the\\nfair value of each reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. We estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a valuation technique based on a multiple\\nof earnings or discounted cash flows. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we would be required to complete a second step to\\ndetermine the amount of goodwill impairment. In the second step, we would determine an implied fair value of the reporting unit\\'s goodwill by allocating the reporting unit\\'s fair value to all of the\\nassets and liabilities other than goodwill. We then would compare the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount and recognize the difference as an impairment charge. \\n\\nThe\\nassumptions we used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units are based on historical performance as well as forecasts used in our current business plan and require\\nconsiderable management judgment. The fair value measurements used for our goodwill impairment testing use significant unobservable inputs which reflect our own assumptions about the inputs that\\nmarket participants would use in measuring fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is also impacted by our overall market capitalization and may be impacted by volatility in our stock price\\nand assumed control premium, among other items. \\n\\nAs\\nof May 31, 2012, we have four operating segments which are also considered to be our reporting units as defined by the accounting standard for goodwill: Aviation Supply Chain;\\nGovernment and Defense Services; Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul and Structures and Systems. During the fourth quarter of 2012, our stock price declined steeply and at the end of the year traded\\nbelow our book value. Based on the \\n\\n37\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**\\n\\nresults\\nof the step one impairment test performed as of May 31, 2012, we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its net asset carrying value. Accordingly,\\nthere was no indication of impairment and the second step was not performed. \\n\\nThe\\namount reported under the caption \"Goodwill and other intangible assets, net\" is comprised of goodwill and intangible assets associated with acquisitions we made, principally since\\nthe beginning of fiscal 1998. During 2012, we acquired Telair® International GmbH (\"Telair\"), Nordisk Aviation Products, AS (\"Nordisk\") and Airinmar Holdings Limited (\"Airinmar\"), which\\nincreased goodwill by $128,599. \\n\\nGoodwill\\nby segment is as follows: \\n\\n**May  31, **\\n\\n**2012**\\n\\n**2011**\\n\\nAviation Supply Chain\\n\\n$\\n40,596\\n\\n$\\n20,040\\n\\nGovernment and Defense Services\\n\\n38,304\\n\\n38,304\\n\\nMaintenance, Repair and Overhaul\\n\\n28,108\\n\\n28,108\\n\\nStructures and Systems\\n\\n155,592\\n\\n47,549\\n\\n$\\n262,600\\n\\n$\\n134,001\\n\\nAt\\nMay 31, 2012 and 2011, intangible assets, other than goodwill, are comprised of the following: \\n\\n**May  31, **\\n\\n**2012**\\n\\n**2011**\\n\\nAmortizable intangible assets:\\n\\nCustomer relationships\\n\\n$\\n113,384\\n\\n$\\n39,449\\n\\nDeveloped technology\\n\\n30,008\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\nLease agreements\\n\\n21,500\\n\\n21,500\\n\\nFAA certificates\\n\\n5,000\\n\\n5,000\\n\\nCovenants not to compete\\n\\n1,570\\n\\n1,570\\n\\nTrademarks\\n\\n600\\n\\n600\\n\\nOther\\n\\n300\\n\\n300\\n\\n172,362\\n\\n68,419\\n\\nAccumulated amortization\\n\\n(34,094\\n)\\n\\n(21,323\\n)\\n\\n138,268\\n\\n47,096\\n\\nUnamortized intangible assets:\\n\\nTrademarks\\n\\n16,694\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n$\\n154,962\\n\\n$\\n47,096\\n\\nCustomer\\nrelationships are being amortized over one- to twenty-year periods, developed technology is being amortized over a seven- to thirty-year period, the\\nlease agreements are being amortized over an eighteen-year period, the FAA certificates are being amortized over a twenty-year period and the covenants not to compete are being\\namortized over a three-year period.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)**\\n\\namount\\nof amortization expense for intangible assets in each of the next five fiscal years is $12,943 in 2013, $9,030 in 2014, $8,981 in 2015, $8,820 in 2016 and $8,820 in 2017. \\n\\n_Cash and Cash Equivalents_\\n\\nAt May 31, 2012 and 2011, there were no cash equivalents. \\n\\n_Marketable Securities_\\n\\nOccasionally we will invest in equity securities and classify these equity securities as available for sale in the Consolidated Balance\\nSheet. As of May 31, 2012 and 2011, we had no amounts invested in available for sale securities. \\n\\nDuring\\nfiscal 2010, we sold investments in securities that were classified as available for sale. The loss on sale of these investments was $1,150. \\n\\n_Foreign Currency_\\n\\nOur foreign subsidiaries utilize the local currency as their functional currency. All balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries\\ntransacting business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated at year-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.\\nTranslation adjustments are excluded from the results of operations and are recorded in stockholders\\' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. \\n\\n_Financial Instruments and Concentrations of Market or Credit Risk_\\n\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of market or credit risk consist principally of trade receivables.\\nWhile our trade receivables are diverse and represent a number of entities and geographic regions, the majority are with the U.S. Department of Defense and its contractors and entities in the aviation\\nindustry. Accounts receivable due from the U.S. Department of Defense were $50,598 and $70,652 at May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We perform regular evaluations of customer payment\\nexperience, current financial condition and risk analysis. We may require collateral in the form of security interests in assets, letters of credit, and/or obligation guarantees from financial\\ninstitutions for transactions executed on other than normal trade terms. \\n\\nThe\\ncarrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings and accounts and trade notes payable approximate fair value because of the\\nshort-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of long-term debt bearing a variable interest rate approximates fair value. \\n\\nFair\\nvalue estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve\\nuncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. \\n\\n_Inventories_\\n\\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (estimated net realizable value). Cost is determined by the specific\\nidentification, average cost or first-in, first-out methods. From time-to-time, we \\n\\n39\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

Costs are assigned to these individual parts and components utilizing list prices from original equipment\\nmanufacturers and recent sales history. \\n\\nThe\\nfollowing is a summary of inventories: \\n\\n**May  31, **\\n\\n**2012**\\n\\n**2011**\\n\\nRaw materials and parts\\n\\n$\\n101,257\\n\\n$\\n61,314\\n\\nWork-in-process\\n\\n64,682\\n\\n51,725\\n\\nAircraft and engine parts, components and finished goods\\n\\n295,227\\n\\n250,360\\n\\n$\\n461,166\\n\\n$\\n363,399\\n\\n_Equipment under Leases_\\n\\nLease revenue is recognized as earned. The cost of the asset under lease is original purchase price plus overhaul costs. Depreciation\\nfor aircraft is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated service life of the equipment. The balance sheet classification of equipment under lease is generally based on\\nlease term, with fixed-term leases less than twelve months generally classified as short-term and all others generally classified as long-term. \\n\\nEquipment\\non short-term lease includes aircraft engines and parts on or available for lease to satisfy customers\\' immediate short-term requirements. The leases\\nare renewable with fixed terms, which generally vary from one to twelve months. Equipment on long-term lease consists of aircraft and engines on lease with commercial airlines generally\\nfor more than twelve months. \\n\\nWe\\nare required to test for impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from\\nits undiscounted cash flows. When applying accounting standards addressing impairment to our aircraft and engine portfolio, we utilize certain assumptions to estimate future undiscounted cash flows,\\nincluding current and future lease rates, lease terms, residual values and market conditions and trends impacting future demand (see Note 12\\x97Restructuring and Impairment Charges).\\nUnfavorable differences between actual and expected results could result in future impairments in our aircraft and engine lease portfolio. \\n\\nFuture\\nrent due to us under non-cancelable leases during each of the next five fiscal years is $16,675 in 2013, $16,031 in 2014, $14,414 in 2015, $8,354 in 2016 and $6,916 in\\n2017. \\n\\n_Property, Plant and Equipment_\\n\\nDepreciation is computed on the straight-line method over useful lives of 10-40 years for buildings and\\nimprovements and 3-10 years for equipment, furniture and fixtures and capitalized software. Aircraft and major components in service to support our Airlift business are depreciated\\nover their estimated useful lives which is generally 7-20 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the applicable\\nlease. \\n\\n40\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

During fiscal 2011 Treasury stock decreased $4,016 reflecting the re-issuance of shares upon exercise of stock options, net\\nof shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax obligations, and restricted stock award grants of $6,692, partially offset by the purchase of treasury shares of $2,539 and the impact of net share\\nsettlements of $137 of bond hedge and warrants associated with convertible bond repurchases during fiscal 2011. During fiscal 2010, Treasury stock increased $1,288 reflecting the impact of net share\\nsettlements of $338 of bond hedge and warrants associated with convertible bond repurchases during fiscal 2010, and the impact from shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax obligations associated with\\nthe exercise of stock options of $950. \\n\\n_Use of Estimates_\\n\\nWe have made estimates and utilized certain assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of\\ncontingent liabilities to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Actual results could differ from those\\nestimates. \\n\\n41\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

Financing Arrangements**\\n\\n_Revolving Credit Facilities_\\n\\nOn April 12, 2011, we entered into an agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as\\nadministrative agent for the lenders (as amended, the \"Credit Agreement\"), providing for an unsecured revolving credit facility that we can draw upon for general corporate purposes. The revolving\\ncommitment was originally $400,000 and on October 13, 2011 was increased to $580,000. Under certain circumstances, we may request an increase to the revolving commitment by an aggregate amount\\nof up to $100,000, not to exceed $680,000 in total. The Credit Agreement expires on April 12, 2016. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the offered Eurodollar Rate (defined\\nas the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate) plus 125 to 225 basis points based on certain financial measurements if a Eurodollar Rate loan, or at the offered fluctuating Base Rate plus 25 to 125\\nbasis points based on certain financial measurements if a Base Rate loan. Borrowings outstanding under this facility at May 31, 2012 were $280,000 and there were approximately $14,329 of\\noutstanding letters of credit which reduced the availability of this facility. We also have $4,370 available under a foreign line of credit. \\n\\nThe\\nCredit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum tangible net worth.

Interest under the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually on March 1 and September 1. \\n\\nHolders\\nmay convert their Convertible Notes based on a conversion rate of 28.6144 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a\\nconversion price of $34.95 per share, only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2008 (and only during such calendar quarter) if,\\nas of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter, the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of\\nsuch preceding calendar quarter is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter; (ii) during the five business\\nday period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes of the applicable series for each day of that period was less than 98% of the\\nproduct of the closing price of our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate; (iii) if a designated event or similar change of control transaction occurs; (iv) upon specified\\ncorporate transactions; or (v) beginning on February 1, 2014, in the case of the 2014 notes, or February 1, 2016, in the case of the 2016 notes, and ending at the close of\\nbusiness on the business day immediately preceding the applicable maturity date. \\n\\nUpon\\nconversion, a holder of the Convertible Notes will receive for each $1,000 principal amount, in lieu of common stock, an amount in cash equal to the lesser of (i) $1,000 and\\n(ii) the conversion value of a number of shares of our common stock equal to the conversion rate. If the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, we will also deliver at our election,\\ncash or common stock or a combination thereof having a value equal to such excess amount. \\n\\nThe\\nConvertible Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Costs associated\\nwith the issuance and sale of the Convertible Notes of approximately $4,366 are being amortized using the effective interest method over a six- and eight-year period. \\n\\nIn\\nconnection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (\"Note Hedges\") with respect to our common stock with Merrill Lynch\\nFinancial Markets, Inc. (\"Hedge Provider\"). The Note Hedges are exercisable solely in connection with any conversion of the Convertible Notes and provide for us to receive shares of our common\\nstock from the Hedge Provider equal to the number of shares issuable to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion.

The Note Hedges and warrant transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon future conversion of\\nthe Convertible Notes and generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the Convertible Notes to approximately $48.83 per share. \\n\\nNet\\nproceeds from the Convertible Notes transaction after paying expenses were approximately $214,410 and were used to repay the balance outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit\\nfacility, to pay for the net cost of the Note Hedges and warrant transactions and for general corporate purposes. \\n\\nOn\\nFebruary 1, 2006, we completed the sale of $150,000 principal amount of convertible senior notes. The notes are due on February 1, 2026 unless earlier redeemed,\\nrepurchased or converted, and bear interest at 1.75% payable semiannually on February 1 and August 1. \\n\\nA\\nholder may convert the notes into shares of common stock based on a conversion rate of 34.5950 shares per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of\\napproximately $28.91 per share, under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter beginning after March 31, 2006 (and only during such calendar quarter), if, as of the\\nlast day of the preceding calendar quarter, the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of such\\npreceding calendar quarter is more than 120% of the applicable conversion price per share of common stock on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter; (ii) during the five business day\\nperiod after any five consecutive trading day period in which the \"trading price\" per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each day of that period was less than 98% of the product of the closing price\\nof our common stock and the then applicable conversion rate; (iii) upon a redemption notice; (iv) if a designated event or similar change of control transaction occurs; (v) upon\\nspecified corporate transactions; or (vi) during the ten trading day period ending at the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the stated maturity date on the notes.\\nUpon conversion, we will have the right to deliver, in lieu of shares of our common stock, cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our option, in an amount per note equal to the\\napplicable conversion rate multiplied by the applicable stock price. \\n\\nWe\\nmay redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after February 6, 2013 at specified redemption prices. Holders of the notes have the right to require us to\\npurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes on February 1, 2013, 2016 and 2021 at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to\\nthe purchase date. The notes are senior, unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. \\n\\nThe\\nmortgage loan due August 1, 2015 is secured by our Wood Dale, Illinois facility.

Collectively, the convertible notes were retired for $11,543 cash, and the gain of $893, after consideration of unamortized debt issuance costs, is recorded in (loss) gain on\\nextinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income. \\n\\nWe\\nare subject to a number of covenants under our financing arrangements, including restrictions which relate to the payment of cash dividends, maintenance of minimum net working capital\\nand tangible net worth levels, fixed charge coverage ratio, sales of assets, additional financing, purchase of our shares and other matters. We are in compliance with all financial covenants under our\\nfinancing arrangements.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities**\\n\\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt. During the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we entered into two derivative\\nfinancial instruments in order to manage our variable interest rate exposure over a medium- to long-term period. In June 2011, we entered into a floating-to-fixed\\ninterest rate swap to hedge interest on $50,000 of notional principal balance under our revolving credit agreement. Also in June 2011, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement on $50,000 of\\nnotional principal interest under our revolving credit agreement. \\n\\nWe\\ndo not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any instruments with leverage or prepayment features. In connection with derivative financial\\ninstruments, there exists the risk of the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. We mitigate this risk by performing financial reviews before the contract is\\nentered into, as well as on-going periodic evaluations. We do not expect any significant losses from counterparty defaults. \\n\\nWe\\nclassify the derivatives as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet. Accounting for the change in fair value of the derivatives is a function of whether the instrument qualifies\\nfor, and has been designated as, a hedging relationship, and the type of hedging relationship. As of May 31, 2012, all of our derivative instruments were classified as cash flow hedges. The\\nfair value of the interest rate swap and interest cap agreements represents the difference in the present values of cash flows calculated at the contracted interest rates and at current market\\ninterest rates at the end of the reporting period. \\n\\nThe\\nfair value of the Company\\'s interest rate derivatives are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. At May 31, 2012, the fair value of our interest rate\\nderivatives was recorded as follows: \\n\\n**  \\nDerivative  \\n\\nAssets **\\n\\n**Derivative  \\n\\nLiabilities **\\n\\n**Balance Sheet Classification**\\n\\n**Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\n\\n**\\n\\n**May  31, 2012 **\\n\\n**May  31, 2012 **\\n\\nInterest rate cap\\n\\nLong-term assets\\n\\n$\\n\\n249\\n\\n$\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\nInterest rate swap\\n\\nLong-term liabilities\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n(4,479\\n)\\n\\nWe\\ninclude gains and losses on the derivative instruments in other comprehensive income (loss). We recognize the gains and losses on our derivative instruments as an adjustment to\\ninterest expense in the period the hedged interest payment affects earnings. The impact of the interest rate swap and interest cap agreement for the year ended May 31, 2012 was a\\npre-tax loss of $5,981 recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We expect minimal gain or loss to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. \\n\\n**4. Stock-Based Compensation**\\n\\nWe provide stock-based awards under the AAR CORP. Stock Benefit Plan (\"Stock Benefit Plan\") which has been approved by our stockholders. Under the Stock Benefit Plan, we are authorized\\nto issue stock options to employees and non-employee directors that allow the grant recipients to purchase shares of common stock at a price not less than the fair market value of the\\ncommon stock on the date of grant. Generally, stock options awarded expire ten years from the date of grant and are exercisable in three, four or five equal annual increments commencing one year after\\nthe date of grant. We issue common stock upon the exercise of stock options. In addition to stock options, the Stock Benefit Plan also provides for the grant of restricted stock awards and\\nperformance-based restricted stock awards.

Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)**\\n\\nperformance-based\\nawards earned, subject to vesting, is based on achievement of certain Company-wide financial goals or stock price targets. The Stock Benefit Plan also provides for the\\ngrant of stock appreciation units and restricted stock units; however, to date, no such awards have been granted. \\n\\nRestricted\\nstock grants are designed, among other things, to align employee interests with the interests of stockholders and to encourage the recipient to build a career with us.\\nRestricted stock typically vests over periods of three to ten years from date of grant. Restricted stock grants may be performance-based with vesting to occur over periods of one to ten years. All\\nrestricted stock that has been granted and earned according to performance criteria carries full dividend and voting rights, regardless of whether it has vested. \\n\\nTypically,\\nstock options and restricted stock are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting if the employee\\'s employment terminates for any reason other than death, disability or\\nretirement. A total of 8,809,000 shares have been granted under the Stock Benefit Plan since its inception, and as of May 31, 2012, a total of 2,322,527 shares were available for future grant\\nunder the Stock Benefit Plan. \\n\\n_Stock Options_\\n\\nDuring fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we granted stock options representing 169,281 shares 720,970 shares and 694,500 shares,\\nrespectively. \\n\\nThe\\nweighted average fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $11.42, $8.06 and $7.45, respectively. The fair value of each stock option grant was\\nestimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: \\n\\n---  \\n\\n**Stock Options Granted  \\n\\nIn Fiscal Year **\\n\\n**2012**\\n\\n**2011**\\n\\n**2010**\\n\\nRisk-free interest rate\\n\\n1.5\\n%\\n\\n1.8\\n%\\n\\n2.3\\n%\\n\\nExpected volatility of common stock\\n\\n46.1\\n%\\n\\n47.0\\n%\\n\\n49.1\\n%\\n\\nDividend yield\\n\\n1.1\\n%\\n\\n0.0\\n%\\n\\n0.0\\n%\\n\\nExpected option term in years\\n\\n5.7\\n\\n5.8\\n\\n6.0\\n\\nThe\\nrisk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common\\nstock and the expected option term represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical exercise trends. The dividend yield represents our\\nanticipated cash dividends at the grant date over the expected option term. \\n\\n50\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

The Rights become exercisable (and separate from the shares) when certain specified events occur, including the acquisition of 15% or more of the common stock\\nby a person or group (an \"Acquiring Person\") or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer for 15% or more of the common stock. \\n\\nIn\\nthe event that an Acquiring Person acquires 15% or more of the common stock, or if we are the surviving corporation in a merger involving an Acquiring Person or if the Acquiring\\nPerson engages in certain types of self-dealing transactions, each Right entitles the holder to purchase for $140 per share (or the then-current exercise price), shares of our\\ncommon stock having a market value of $280 (or two times the exercise price), subject to certain exceptions. Similarly, if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination or 50% or more of\\nour assets or earning power is sold, each Right entitles the holder to purchase at the then-current exercise price that number of shares of common stock of the surviving corporation having\\na market value of two times the exercise price. The Rights do not entitle the holder thereof to vote or to receive dividends. The Rights will expire on August 6, 2017, and may be redeemed by us\\nfor $.01 per Right under certain circumstances. \\n\\n52\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

We have no unrecognized tax benefits as of\\nMay 31, 2012. \\n\\n**6. Earnings Per Share**\\n\\nThe computation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. The computation of diluted earnings per share is\\nbased on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus, when their effect is dilutive, incremental shares consisting of shares subject to stock options, shares\\nissuable upon vesting of restricted stock awards and shares to be issued upon conversion of convertible debt. \\n\\nWe\\nuse the \"if-converted\" method in calculating the diluted earnings per share effect of the assumed conversion of our contingently convertible debt issued in fiscal 2006\\nbecause the principal for that issuance can be settled in stock, cash or a combination thereof. Under the \"if converted\" method, the after-tax effect of interest expense related to the\\nconvertible securities is added back to net income, and the convertible debt is assumed to have been converted into common shares at the beginning of the period. \\n\\nIn\\naccordance with ASC 260-10-45, _Share-Based Payment Arrangements and Participating Securities and the Two-Class\\nMethod_ , our unvested restricted stock awards are deemed participating securities since these shares are entitled to participate in dividends declared on common shares. During\\nperiods of net income, the calculation of earnings per share for common stock exclude income attributable to unvested restricted stock awards from the numerator and exclude the dilutive impact of\\nthose shares from the denominator. During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company. \\n\\nWe\\nadopted the provisions of this standard during fiscal 2011. The impact of this standard was not material for fiscal 2010. \\n\\n55\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

Employee Benefit Plans**\\n\\nWe have defined contribution and defined benefit plans covering substantially all full-time domestic employees and certain employees in The Netherlands, Germany and Norway. \\n\\n_Defined Benefit Plans_\\n\\nPrior to January 1, 2000, the pension plan for domestic salaried and non-union hourly employees had a benefit\\nformula based primarily on years of service and compensation. Effective January 1, 2000, we converted our defined benefit plan for substantially all domestic salaried and certain hourly\\nemployees to a cash balance pension plan. Under the cash balance pension plan, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in an account that grows with annual pay-based credits\\nand interest on the account balance. The interest crediting rate under our cash balance plan is determined quarterly and is equal to 100% of the average 30-year treasury rate for the\\nsecond month preceding the applicable quarter published by the Internal Revenue Service. The average interest crediting rate under our cash balance plan for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2012\\nwas 5.0%. Effective June 1, 2005, the existing cash balance plan was frozen and the annual pay-based credits were discontinued. Also effective June 1, 2005, the defined\\ncontribution plan was modified to include increased employer contributions and an enhanced profit sharing formula. Defined pension benefits for certain union hourly employees are based primarily on a\\nfixed amount per year of service. \\n\\nCertain\\nforeign operations of domestic subsidiaries also have a defined benefit pension plan. Benefit formulas are based generally on years of service and compensation. It is the policy\\nof these subsidiaries to fund at least the minimum amounts required by local laws and regulations. \\n\\nWe\\nprovide eligible outside directors with benefits upon retirement on or after age 65 provided they have completed at least five years of service as a director. Benefits are paid\\nquarterly in cash equal to 25% of the annual retainer fee payable to active outside directors. Payment of benefits commence upon retirement and continue for a period equal to the total number of years\\nof the retired director\\'s service up to a maximum of ten years, or death, whichever occurs first. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001, we terminated the plan for any new members of the Board of\\nDirectors first elected after May 31, 2001. \\n\\n57\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

The investment goals are to provide a total return that, over\\nthe long term, optimizes the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable risk, and to maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers. We believe\\nthat there are no significant concentrations of risk within our plan assets as of May 31, 2012. Direct investments in our securities and the use of derivatives for the purpose of speculation\\nare not permitted. The assets of the U.S. pension plans are invested primarily in equity and fixed income mutual funds, individual common stocks and fund-of-funds hedge funds. \\n\\nThe\\nassets of the non-domestic plan are invested in compliance with local laws and regulations and are comprised primarily of equity and fixed income mutual funds. \\n\\nTo\\ndevelop our expected long-term rate of return assumption on domestic plans, we use long-term historical return information for our targeted asset mix and\\ncurrent market conditions. \\n\\nThe\\nfollowing table sets forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, pension plan assets at their fair value as of May 31, 2012: \\n\\n**Level  11 **\\n\\n**Level  22 **\\n\\n**Level  33 **\\n\\n**Total**\\n\\nEquity securities:\\n\\nLarge/medium capitalization\\n\\n$\\n17,500\\n\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\n$\\n\\x97\\n\\n$\\n17,500\\n\\nSmall capitalization\\n\\n6,379\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n6,379\\n\\nInternational\\n\\n5,452\\n\\n7,460\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n12,912\\n\\nFixed income\\n\\n11,338\\n\\n25,952\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n37,290\\n\\nHedge funds\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n3,837\\n\\n9,358\\n\\n13,195\\n\\nCash and other\\n\\n145\\n\\n248\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\n393\\n\\nTotal investments\\n\\n$\\n40,814\\n\\n$\\n37,497\\n\\n$\\n9,358\\n\\n$\\n87,669\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n1\\nQuoted\\nprices in active markets\\n\\n2\\nSignificant\\nother observable inputs\\n\\n3\\nSignificant\\nother unobservable inputs \\n\\n61\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

We anticipate contributing $5,500 to $7,500 during fiscal 2013. \\n\\n_Additional Information_\\n\\nThe estimated amounts for our plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into expense over the next fiscal\\nyear are as follows: \\n\\n---  \\n\\nAmortization of net actuarial loss\\n\\n$\\n1,874\\n\\nAmortization of prior service cost\\n\\n$\\n157\\n\\n_Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions_\\n\\nWe provide health and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees. The postretirement plans are unfunded and in fiscal 1995,\\nwe completed termination of postretirement health and life insurance benefits attributable to future services of collective bargaining and other domestic employees. The unfunded projected benefit\\nobligation for this plan was $1,136 and $1,187 as of May 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We have omitted substantially all of the required disclosures related to this plan because the plan is\\nnot material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. \\n\\n_Defined Contribution Plan_\\n\\nThe defined contribution plan is a profit sharing plan which is intended to qualify as a 401(k) plan under the Internal Revenue Code.\\nUnder the plan, employees may contribute up to 75% of their pretax compensation, subject to applicable regulatory limits. We may make matching contributions up to 5% of compensation as well as\\ndiscretionary profit sharing contributions. Our contributions vest on a pro-rata basis during the first three years of employment. We also provide profit sharing benefits for certain\\nexecutives and key employees to supplement the benefits provided by the defined contribution plan. Expense charged to results of operations for our matching contributions, including profit sharing\\ncontributions, was $13,159 in fiscal 2012, $10,469 in fiscal 2011 and $8,065 in fiscal 2010 for these plans. \\n\\n62\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

Acquisitions**\\n\\nOn December 2, 2011, we acquired Telair and Nordisk. Telair is a leader in the design, manufacture and support of cargo loading systems for wide-body and\\nnarrow-body aircraft with established positions on the world\\'s most popular current and next-generation passenger and freighter aircraft. Telair operates from facilities in\\nGermany, Sweden and Singapore. Nordisk designs and manufactures heavy duty pallets and lightweight cargo containers for commercial airlines from facilities in Norway and China. The purchase price of\\nthe acquisition was $280,000 paid at closing, plus or minus a working capital adjustment. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the working capital adjustment was finalized, which increased the\\npurchase price to $296,500. The businesses operate as part of our Structures and Systems segment. \\n\\nOn\\nOctober 11, 2011, we acquired Airinmar, a sophisticated repair, outsourcing and warranty claim manager. Airinmar operates as part of our Aviation Supply Chain segment. Total\\nconsideration is estimated to be $43,500, which included $23,200 cash paid at closing, and a potential earn-out payment of $20,300. The potential earn-out payment is based upon\\nAirinmar achieving certain EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) levels over a two-year period, as well as retaining certain key customers. In accordance\\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a liability of $20,300 was recognized as an estimate of the acquisition date fair value of the earn-out and\\nwas included in _Other non-current liabilities_ on our consolidated balance sheet as of February  29, 2012. During the fourth quarter of\\n2012, this estimate was reduced by $3,367 and this change in the fair value of the earn-out was recognized in earnings. \\n\\nWe\\nare continuing our review of our fair value estimate of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period, which will conclude as soon as we receive the\\ninformation we are seeking about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, or learn that more information is not available. This measurement period will not exceed one year from\\nthe acquisition date. At the effective date of the acquisition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are generally required to be measured at fair value. \\n\\nOur\\nfair value estimate of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is pending completion of several elements, including the finalization of an independent appraisal and valuations of\\nfair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and final review by our management. The primary areas that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of inventories, property and\\nequipment, intangible assets, favorable or unfavorable contracts, operating leases or commitments, contingent liabilities and income and non-income related taxes. Accordingly, there could\\nbe material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements, including changes in our depreciation and amortization expense related to the valuation of property and equipment and intangible\\nassets acquired and their respective useful lives among other adjustments. \\n\\nThe\\nfinal determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be based on the established fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed as of the\\nacquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. The final determination of the purchase price, fair values and resulting\\ngoodwill may differ significantly from what is reflected in the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\n63\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

These aircraft are available for lease or sale\\nto commercial air carriers. \\n\\n_Aircraft Owned through Joint Ventures_\\n\\nAs of May 31, 2012 and 2011, we had ownership interests in 18 and 23 aircraft, respectively, with joint venture partners. As of\\nMay 31, 2012 and 2011, our equity investment in the aircraft owned with joint venture partners was approximately $41,326 and $39,994, respectively, and is included in  _Investment in joint ventures_\\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our aircraft joint ventures represent investments in limited liability companies that\\nare accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our membership interest in each of these limited liability companies is 50% and the primary business of these companies is the acquisition,\\nownership, lease and disposition of certain commercial aircraft. Aircraft are purchased with cash contributions by the members of the companies and debt financing provided to the limited liability\\ncompanies on a limited recourse basis. Under the terms of servicing agreements with certain of the limited liability companies, we provide administrative services and technical advisory services,\\nincluding \\n\\n64\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

As part of the agreements, we purchased from the customer approximately $58,400 of equipment to support the program. The equipment is included in equipment on long-term\\nlease on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and is being depreciated on a straight-line basis over 10 years to a 30% residual value.

Commitments and Contingencies**\\n\\nOn October 3, 2003, we entered into a sale-leaseback transaction whereby we sold and leased back a facility located in Garden City, New York. The lease is classified\\nas an operating lease. Net proceeds from the sale of the facility were $13,991 and the cost and related accumulated depreciation of the facility of $9,472 and $4,595, respectively, were removed from\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet at the time of sale. The gain realized on the sale of $9,114 has been deferred and is being amortized over the 20-year lease term. The unamortized balance of\\nthe deferred gain as of May 31, 2012 is $5,227 and is included in _Other liabilities and deferred income_ on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \\n\\nIn\\naddition to the Garden City lease, we lease other facilities and equipment under agreements that are classified as operating leases that expire at various dates through 2034. Under\\nthe terms of one of the facility lease agreements, we are entitled to receive rent credits as we increase the space we occupy. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we received $239, $34 and $47,\\nrespectively, of such rent credits. We are treating the rent credits as lease incentives, which are being amortized over the term of the lease.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges**\\n\\nIn order to improve efficiencies and streamline operations in the Structures and Systems segment, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we decided to close two manufacturing plants\\nand idle one other facility. The financial impact included restructuring and other charges of $3,700. Approximately $1,200 was recorded as severance expense and approximately $2,500 was recorded for\\nasset impairments to reduce the carrying value of certain equipment and inventory to net realizable value. The charges are recorded in _Costs of sales \\x97restructuring\\nand impairment_ in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \\n\\nDuring\\nthe fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we decided to offer one narrow body aircraft for sale from our wholly-owned aircraft portfolio and subsequent to May 31, 2011, we entered\\ninto a letter of intent to sell the aircraft to a foreign air carrier. As a result, we recorded a $5,355 pre-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the aircraft to its net\\nrealizable value, which was approximately $8,850 at May 31, 2011. \\n\\n**13. Gain on Sale of Product Line**\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we sold substantially all of the assets of a non-strategic product line within our Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment.\\nProceeds from the sale were $10,000 cash paid at closing, and the net carrying value of the assets sold was $4,078, resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of product line of $5,922. The gain\\non this transaction has been classified as a component of operating income. \\n\\n**14. Other Noncurrent Assets**\\n\\nAt May 31, 2012 and 2011, other noncurrent assets consisted of the following: \\n\\n**May  31, **\\n\\n**2012**\\n\\n**2011**\\n\\nCapitalized program development costs\\n\\n$\\n91,942\\n\\n$\\n69,413\\n\\nCosts in excess of billings\\n\\n27,872\\n\\n19,404\\n\\nNotes receivable\\n\\n18,869\\n\\n2,443\\n\\nAssets under deferred compensation plan\\n\\n16,315\\n\\n16,421\\n\\nCash surrender value of life insurance\\n\\n15,632\\n\\n15,164\\n\\nLicenses fees\\n\\n15,072\\n\\n\\x97\\n\\nDebt issuance costs\\n\\n10,025\\n\\n5,281\\n\\nOther\\n\\n13,185\\n\\n14,012\\n\\n$\\n208,912\\n\\n$\\n142,138\\n\\n_Program Development Costs_\\n\\nIn June 2005, we announced that our Cargo Systems business in our Structures and Systems segment was selected to provide cargo handling\\nsystems for the new Airbus A400M Military Transport Aircraft (\"A400M\"). Our portion of the revenue from this program is expected to exceed $300,000 through fiscal 2021, based on sales projections of\\nthe A400M. As of May 31, 2012, we have capitalized, net of reimbursements, $91,942 of costs associated with the engineering and development of the cargo system. Sales and related cost of sales\\nwill be recognized on the units of delivery method. \\n\\n68\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

Other Noncurrent Assets (Continued)**\\n\\n_License Fees_\\n\\nIn June 2011, we entered into a ten-year agreement with Unison Industries to be the exclusive worldwide aftermarket\\ndistributor for Unison\\'s electrical components, sensors, switches and other systems for aircraft and industrial uses. The agreement is expected to generate approximately $600,000 in revenues for us\\nover its ten-year term. In connection with the agreement, we agreed to pay Unison Industries $20,000 for the exclusive distribution rights with $7,000 paid in June 2011, and $1,300 payable\\nby January 31 of each calendar year beginning in January 2012 through 2021. \\n\\nAs\\nof May 31, 2012, the unamortized balance of the license is $15,072 and is being amortized over a ten-year period. The current portion of the deferred payments of\\n$1,160 is recorded in _Accrued liabilities_ and the long-term portion of $7,607 is included in _Other liabilities and\\ndeferred income_ on the consolidated balance sheet. \\n\\n**15. Business Segment Information**\\n\\n_Segment Reporting_\\n\\nWe report our activities in four business segments: Aviation Supply Chain; Government and Defense Services; Maintenance, Repair and\\nOverhaul; and Structures and Systems. \\n\\nSales\\nin the Aviation Supply Chain segment are derived from the sale and lease of a wide variety of new, overhauled and repaired engine and airframe parts and components principally to\\nthe commercial aviation market. We also offer customized inventory supply chain management programs and aircraft component repair management services. Sales also include the sale and lease of\\ncommercial aircraft and jet engines and technical and advisory services. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor, overhead (primarily indirect labor, facility cost and\\ninsurance) and the cost of lease revenue (primarily depreciation and insurance). \\n\\nSales\\nin the Government and Defense Services segment are derived from the sale of new and overhauled engine and airframe parts and components, customized performance based logistics\\nprograms, expeditionary airlift services, aircraft modifications and engineering, design, and integration services to our government and defense customers. Cost of sales consists principally of the\\ncost of the product (primarily aircraft and engine parts), direct labor, overhead and aircraft maintenance costs. \\n\\nSales\\nin the Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul segment are principally derived from aircraft maintenance and modifications, engineering services, painting, and the repair, overhaul and\\nexchange of landing gear. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product (primarily replacement aircraft parts), direct labor and overhead. \\n\\nSales\\nin the Structures and Systems segment are derived from the engineering, design and manufacture of containers, pallets and shelters used to support the U.S. military\\'s requirements\\nfor a mobile and agile force, heavy-duty pallets and lightweight cargo containers for the commercial market, complex machined and fabricated parts, components and sub-systems\\nfor various aerospace and defense programs and other applications, in-plane cargo loading and handling systems for commercial and military applications and composite products for aviation\\nand industrial use. Cost of sales consists principally of the cost of product, direct labor and overhead. \\n\\n69\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**  \\nAAR CORP.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  **\\n\\nAs required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we conducted an\\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2012. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with\\nparticipation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures. Therefore, effective\\ndisclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of May 31, 2012, ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed under the Act is\\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. \\n\\nThere\\nwere no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three-month period ended May 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \\n\\n**MANAGEMENT REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING**\\n\\nManagement of AAR CORP. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such\\nterm is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Act. The Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control systems, no matter how\\nwell designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems which are determined to be effective provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and\\npresentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of\\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n\\nManagement\\nassessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in Internal\\nControl\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. \\n\\nBased\\non our assessment, management concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2012. \\n\\nThe\\nscope of managements\\' assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting includes all of the Company\\'s business units except for Telair and Nordisk, which\\nwere acquired by the\\nCompany on December 2, 2011, and Airinmar, which was acquired by the Company on October 11, 2011. Consolidated sales for the year-ended May 31, 2012 were $2,064,998,\\nof which Telair, Nordisk and Airinmar represented $93,880, $25,549 and $26,058, respectively. Consolidated assets as of May 31, 2012 were $2,195,653, of which Telair, Nordisk and Airinmar\\nrepresented $287,587, $53,570 and $46,486, respectively. \\n\\nKPMG LLP,\\nour independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. That report appears below. \\n\\n74\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**\\n\\nTO\\nTHE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF AAR CORP.: \\n\\nWe\\nhave audited AAR CORP. and subsidiaries\\' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal\\nControl\\x97Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company\\'s management is responsible for maintaining effective\\ninternal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report On Internal Control\\nOver Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \\n\\nWe\\nconducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control\\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\\naudit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\n\\nA\\ncompany\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures\\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\\nexpenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\n\\nBecause\\nof its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \\n\\nIn\\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal\\nControl\\x97Integrated Framework issued by COSO. \\n\\nThe\\nscope of managements\\' assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2012 includes all of the Company\\'s business units except for\\nTelair International GmbH (\"Telair\") and Nordisk Aviation Products, AS (\"Nordisk\"), which were acquired by the Company on December 2, 2011, and Airinmar Holdings Limited (\"Airinmar\"),\\nwhich was acquired by the Company on October 11, 2011. Consolidated sales for the year-ended May 31, 2012 were $2,064,998, of which Telair, Nordisk and Airinmar represented\\n$93,880, $25,549 and $26,058, respectively. Consolidated assets as of May 31, 2012 were $2,195,653, of which Telair, Nordisk and Airinmar represented $287,587, $53,570 and $46,486,\\nrespectively. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Airinmar, Telair and Nordisk. \\n\\nWe\\nalso have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of\\nMay 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 2012,\\nand our report dated July 19, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \\n\\n/s/\\nKPMG LLP \\n\\nChicago,\\nIllinois  \\n\\nJuly 19, 2012 \\n\\n75\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n**ITEM 9B.

Business\\n\\nThe Company \\n\\nUnless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us\", \"our\" and the \"company\" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\\n\\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. We organized as a business corporation under the laws of New Jersey on November 23, 1922; however, through predecessor organizations, we trace our heritage in the food business back to 1869. Our principal executive offices are in Camden, New Jersey 08103-1799.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nOur long-term goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. Guided by our purpose\\xa0- \"Real Food That Matters For Life\\'s Moments,\" we expect to deliver this goal by executing against a dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while also expanding into faster-growing spaces. We have made a number of enterprise design and portfolio changes over the past several years in support of this strategy, including the following:   \\n\\n•\\n\\nOn January 29, 2015, we announced plans to implement a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. Under the new design, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are organized in the following divisions: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh.     \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn support of the new enterprise design, we designed and implemented a new Integrated Global Services (IGS) organization to deliver shared services across the company. IGS, which became effective at the beginning of 2016, is expected to reduce costs while increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. We are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organizational structure and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. See \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for additional information on these initiatives.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2013, we acquired Bolthouse Farms and Plum. In 2014, we acquired Kelsen and divested our European simple meals business. Most recently, on June 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet for approximately $230 million. Garden Fresh Gourmet is a provider of refrigerated salsa in North America, and it also produces hummus, dips and tortilla chips. We funded the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition through the issuance of commercial paper. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our recent acquisitions, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our divestiture of the European simple meals business.  \\n\\nFor additional information on our dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while also expanding into faster-growing spaces, see \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\\n\\n2015 Reportable Segments \\n\\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported the results of our operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and Bolthouse and Foodservice. During this period, we had 11 operating segments based on product type and geographic location, and we aggregated the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar economic characteristics, products, production processes, types or classes of customers, distribution methods and regulatory environment. See also Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The 2015 reportable segments are discussed in greater detail below. \\n\\nU.S. Simple Meals \\n\\nThe U.S.\\xa0Simple Meals segment includes the following products: Campbell\\'s condensed and ready-to-serve soups; Swanson broth and stocks; Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbell\\'s gravies, pasta, beans and dinner sauces; Swanson canned poultry; and Plum food and snacks.\\n\\nGlobal Baking and Snacking \\n\\nThe Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following operating segments: Pepperidge Farm cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S.\\xa0retail; Arnott\\'s biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific; and Kelsen cookies globally.\\n\\nInternational Simple Meals and Beverages \\n\\nThe International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates the following operating segments: the retail business in Canada and the simple meals and beverages business in Asia Pacific, Latin America and China. See \"Background\" and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of the European simple meals business, which was historically \\n\\n3 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nincluded in this segment. The results of operations of the European simple meals business have been reflected as discontinued operations. \\n\\nU.S. Beverages\\n\\nThe U.S.\\xa0Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail beverages business, including the following products: V8 juices and beverages, and Campbell\\'s tomato juice.\\n\\nBolthouse and Foodservice\\n\\nBolthouse and Foodservice comprises the Bolthouse Farms carrot products operating segment (Farms), including fresh carrots, juice concentrate and fiber; the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and refrigerated salad dressings operating segment (CPG); the North America Foodservice operating segment; and as of June 29, 2015, the Garden Fresh Gourmet operating segment. The North America Foodservice operating segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada. None of these operating segments meets the criteria for aggregation nor the thresholds for separate disclosure.\\n\\nNew Reportable Segments in 2016\\n\\nAs discussed above, we recently announced plans to organize our businesses into three divisions: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh. At the beginning of 2016, we implemented this new enterprise design, and we are now managing our operations under the design. Accordingly, we will modify our segment reporting as appropriate in future filings.\\n\\nIngredients and Packaging \\n\\nThe ingredient and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food products are purchased from various suppliers. These items are subject to fluctuations in price attributable to a number of factors, including changes in crop size, cattle cycles, disease, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change) during the growing and harvesting seasons. To help reduce some of this price volatility, we use a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts, inventory management practices and various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging. Ingredient inventories are at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only at certain seasons, we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients during their respective seasons. At this time, we do not anticipate any material restrictions on the availability of ingredients or packaging that would have a significant impact on our businesses. For information on the impact of inflation, see \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\\n\\nCustomers \\n\\nIn most of our markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force and our third-party broker and distributor partners. In the U.S., Canada and Latin America, our products are generally resold to consumers in retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. In the Asia Pacific region, our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, convenience stores and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. We make shipments promptly after receipt and acceptance of orders. \\n\\nOur five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2015, 35% in 2014 and 36% in 2013. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales in 2015 and 19% in 2014 and 2013. All of our reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales. \\n\\nTrademarks and Technology \\n\\nAs of September 15, 2015, we owned over 3,700 trademark registrations and applications in over 160 countries. We believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally are valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and have not been found to have become generic. Trademark registrations generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use. We believe that our principal brands, including Arnott\\'s, Bolthouse Farms, Campbell\\'s, Garden Fresh Gourmet, Goldfish, Kjeldsens, Pace, Pepperidge Farm, Plum, Prego, Swanson, and V8, are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used. In addition, some of our products are sold under brands that have been licensed from third parties. \\n\\nAlthough we own a number of valuable patents, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own copyrights, both registered and unregistered, and proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.  \\n\\n4 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nCompetition \\n\\nWe experience worldwide competition in all of our principal products. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories, and includes producers of generic and private label products, as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers. All of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. The number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. \\n\\nWorking Capital \\n\\nFor information relating to our cash and working capital items, see \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" \\n\\nCapital Expenditures \\n\\nDuring 2015, our aggregate capital expenditures were $380 million. We expect to spend approximately $350 million for capital projects in 2016. Major 2016 capital projects include an ongoing Bolthouse Farms beverage and salad dressing capacity expansion project, an ongoing North American warehouse capacity expansion project, a new Australian multi-pack biscuit capacity expansion project and a new refrigeration replacement project at our Virginia, Australia, plant.\\n\\nResearch and Development \\n\\nDuring the last three fiscal years, our expenditures on research and development activities relating to new products and the improvement and maintenance of existing products were $113 million in 2015, $121 million in 2014, and $128 million in 2013. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 was primarily due to savings from cost reduction and restructuring initiatives. The decrease from 2013 to 2014 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and cost savings from restructuring initiatives, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. \\n\\nEnvironmental Matters \\n\\nWe have requirements for the operation and design of our facilities that meet or exceed applicable environmental rules and regulations. Of our $380 million in capital expenditures made during 2015, approximately $12 million was for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. We further estimate that approximately $10 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2016 will be for compliance with U.S. environmental laws and regulations. We believe that continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (both within the U.S. and elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. In addition, we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the U.S. and elsewhere, including the recently-enacted regulations in the U.S. to limit carbon dioxide emissions from electric utilities, relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. While the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position.\\n\\nSeasonality \\n\\nDemand for our products is somewhat seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume due primarily to demand for our soup products. Sales of Kelsen products are also highest in the fall and winter months due primarily to holiday gift giving. Demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year. \\n\\nEmployees \\n\\nOn August\\xa02, 2015, we had approximately 18,600 employees.    \\n\\nFinancial Information \\n\\nFinancial information for our reportable segments and geographic areas is found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For risks attendant to our foreign operations, see \"Risk Factors.\" \\n\\nWebsites \\n\\nOur primary corporate website can be found at www.campbellsoupcompany.com. We make available free of charge at this website (under the \"Investor Center -- Financial Information -- SEC Filings\" caption) all of our reports (including amendments) filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our current reports on Form 8-K. These reports are made available on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after their filing with, or furnishing to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\nAll websites appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are inactive textual references only, and the information in, or accessible through, such websites is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or into any of our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n5 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\\n\\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. \\n\\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry\\n\\nWe operate in the highly competitive food industry and experience international competition in all of our principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of our primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share.\\n\\nOur results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into faster-growing spaces\\n\\nOur strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into faster-growing spaces. Our core businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional mass and grocery channels. Factors that may impact our success include:  \\n\\n•our ability to identify and capitalize on faster-growing spaces;\\n\\n•\\n\\nour ability to identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to new or improved products or packaging or to our existing products;  \\n\\n•our ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans;\\n\\n•our ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs, including digital programs;\\n\\n•our ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers; and\\n\\n•changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete. \\n\\nIf we are not successful in addressing theses factors, our strategy may not be successful and/or our business or financial results may be negatively impacted.  \\n\\nWe may not realize anticipated benefits from our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives \\n\\nWe recently implemented a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. We are also pursuing related initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organization and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. The success of these initiatives presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require extensive negotiations with third parties, such as suppliers and other business partners. As a result, we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiatives. Other events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits, or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. In addition, the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected. Finally, the complexity of the initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization\\'s attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. \\n\\nFrom time-to-time, we may also implement other supply chain, information technology or related initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these additional initiatives, which are often complex. \\n\\nAny failure to implement our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results.\\n\\nOur results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully\\n\\nOur ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include:\\n\\n•the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations;\\n\\n•diversion of management\\'s attention from other business concerns;\\n\\n•potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses;\\n\\n6 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n•potential assumption of unknown liabilities;\\n\\n•the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; \\n\\n•potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and \\n\\n•the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience.  \\n\\nAcquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from us effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Our business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed.  \\n\\nDisruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business\\n\\nOur ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, crop disease and/or crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results.\\n\\nOur non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to our business\\n\\nIn 2015, approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. Our business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following:\\n\\n•unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions;\\n\\n•\\n\\nthe difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;   \\n\\n•\\n\\nthe difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;  \\n\\n•\\n\\nthe adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies;  \\n\\n•\\n\\npolitical or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, armed hostilities or terrorist acts;   \\n\\n•\\n\\nthe possible nationalization of operations;   \\n\\n•\\n\\nthe difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and   \\n\\n•\\n\\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potentially negative tax consequences.  \\n\\nIn addition, we hold assets and incur liabilities, generate revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.\\xa0dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.\\xa0dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S.\\xa0dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S.\\xa0dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.\\n\\nWe face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions\\n\\nCustomer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact us.\\n\\nIncreased regulation or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business or financial results\\n\\nThe manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as \\n\\n7 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nthe health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed labeling requirements), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results.  In addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or could adversely affect our business or financial results.  \\n\\nOur results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materials\\n\\nThe raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including crop size, cattle cycles, disease, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change). To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity.\\n\\nAdverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations\\n\\nOur business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could:\\n\\n•\\n\\nunfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water;  \\n\\n•\\n\\ndisrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products;  \\n\\n•\\n\\ndisrupt the retail operations of our customers; or  \\n\\n•\\n\\nunfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer\\'s ability to purchase, our products.  \\n\\nIn addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. \\n\\nPrice increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace\\n\\nWe intend to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\\n\\nWe may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers\\n\\nOur businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in pursuing our strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers or more favorable terms. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. \\n\\nIn 2015, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. \\n\\n8 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIf our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured\\n\\nWe may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim.  \\n\\nWe may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems\\n\\nOur information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on  our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of our functions, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. If we are unable to prevent material failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations.   \\n\\nOur results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands\\n\\nWe have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted.\\n\\nAn impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth \\n\\nAs of August 2, 2015, we had goodwill of $2.3 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $960 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit\\'s fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth. \\n\\nWe may be adversely impacted by legal proceedings or claims\\n\\nWe are party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in legal proceeding or claims (even if untrue). In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. \\n\\nWe may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans\\n\\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future \\n\\n9 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nfunding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\\n\\nItem 1B.

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\n\\nOVERVIEW \\n\\nDescription of the Company \\n\\nUnless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us\",\"our\" and the \"company\" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.\\n\\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products. Through 2015, we reported the results of operations in the following reportable segments: U.S. Simple Meals; Global Baking and Snacking; International Simple Meals and Beverages; U.S. Beverages; and Bolthouse and Foodservice.  \\n\\nIn 2013, we acquired Bolthouse Farms and Plum. In 2014, we acquired Kelsen and divested our European simple meals business. Most recently, on June 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet for $232 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. Garden Fresh Gourmet is a provider of refrigerated salsa in North America, and it also produces hummus, dips and tortilla chips. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our recent acquisitions, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our divestiture of the European simple meals business.\\n\\nKey Strategies \\n\\nOur long-term goal is to build shareholder value by driving sustainable, profitable net sales growth. Guided by our purpose\\xa0- \"Real Food That Matters For Life\\'s Moments,\" we expect to deliver this goal by executing against a dual strategy of strengthening our core businesses while also expanding into faster-growing spaces.  \\n\\nNew Enterprise Design\\n\\nWe recently implemented a new enterprise design that better aligns with our dual strategy. Under the new design, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are now organized in three divisions focused mainly on product categories. Each division also has a defined portfolio role. The new divisions and their portfolio roles are: \\n\\n•\\n\\nAmericas Simple Meals and Beverages is our largest division. We expect to manage this division for moderate growth, consistent with the categories in which we operate, and for margin expansion. Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, which includes U.S. soup, will serve as a key economic engine for many years to come.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nGlobal Biscuits and Snacks is focused on expanding in developed and developing markets while improving margins. This division unifies our Pepperidge Farm, Arnott\\'s and Kelsen businesses around the world.   \\n\\n•\\n\\nCampbell Fresh includes Bolthouse Farms, Garden Fresh Gourmet and our refrigerated soup business. We plan to make focused investments in this division to accelerate sales growth and to expand into new categories in packaged fresh.   \\n\\nIn support of our new enterprise design, we designed and implemented a new Integrated Global Services (IGS) organization to deliver shared services across the company. IGS became effective at the beginning of 2016 and is a key element in our efforts to reduce costs while also increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. We are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs, such as streamlining our organizational structure and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. In total, we expect the new IGS organization and our other cost savings initiatives to generate approximately $250 million in annual cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018. These savings are above and beyond our existing enabler program. See \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information on these initiatives.\\n\\nDual Strategy  \\n\\nWith this new enterprise design in place, we plan to pursue our dual strategy by: \\n\\n•\\n\\nProviding greater transparency about the food we make;   \\n\\n•\\n\\nFurther embracing digital marketing and e-commerce to connect with consumers and customers in new ways;  \\n\\n•\\n\\nIncreasing our focus on health and wellbeing; and  \\n\\n•\\n\\nExpanding our presence in developing markets.  \\n\\n14 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nProviding Greater Product Transparency\\n\\nOn our www.whatsinmyfood.com website, we are providing consumers with a wide range of detail about how some of our foods and beverages are made and the choices behind the ingredients we use in those products. Initially focused on some of our top U.S. products, such as Campbell\\'s Condensed Tomato and Chicken Noodle soups, we plan to expand this site to include all of our major products in the U.S. and Canada in 2016, with designs to expand globally over the next three fiscal years. We anticipate this enhanced transparency will lead to, or accelerate, changes in our products, including our continued efforts to remove many artificial ingredients where feasible.\\n\\nEmbracing Digital Marketing and E-Commerce \\n\\nWe plan to complement the growing consumer shift to digital and mobile technologies by focusing a larger percentage of our marketing efforts on digital marketing and e-commerce. For example, in 2016 we expect to spend a larger portion of our overall media budget on digital media, while reducing our spending on traditional television media. We also plan to continue our focus on e-commerce capabilities in 2016.\\n\\nIncreasing Focus on Health and Wellbeing\\n\\nCapitalizing on recent consumer and retailer trends towards fresh and/or healthy products, we plan to increase our focus on our fresh and packaged fresh products. While other parts of our business will continue to provide shelf-stable products that are appealing to health-conscious consumers, our new Campbell Fresh division has a diverse portfolio of fresh and packaged fresh offerings that should help retailers attract these important customers. We expect the Campbell Fresh division to provide us with the needed scale to better compete in the growing perimeter of traditional retail outlets. The recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, which provides refrigerated salsa, hummus and dips, as well as tortilla chips, compliments Campbell Fresh\\'s existing portfolio. \\n\\nExpanding Presence in Developing Markets\\n\\nIn 2016, we plan to continue to focus on expanding our presence in developing markets, especially our Global Biscuits and Snacks business in Asia. Our new enterprise design unifies all of our biscuit and snacks brands under a single integrated division - Global Biscuits and Snacks. We expect this new structure to help unlock the value of our biscuit and snack brands and to provide a platform to extend these brands across both faster growing developing markets, as well as our existing developed markets. \\n\\nTo support these four imperatives, we will continue to evaluate external development opportunities, ranging from acquisitions to strategic alliances such as joint ventures and other strategic partnerships.\\n\\nExecutive Summary \\n\\nThis Executive Summary provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows. \\n\\n•\\n\\nThere were 53 weeks in 2014. There were 52 weeks in 2015 and 2013.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nNet sales decreased 2% in 2015 to $8.082 billion, primarily due to the impact of currency translation and one less week compared to the prior year, partly offset by higher selling prices.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nGross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 34.7% from 35.1% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to cost inflation and increased supply chain costs, partly offset by productivity improvements and higher selling prices.   \\n\\n•\\n\\nAdministrative expenses increased 3% to $593 million from $573 million a year ago. The current year included $22 million of costs related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives, and higher incentive compensation costs, partially offset by savings from cost reduction and restructuring initiatives.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nEarnings per share from continuing operations were $2.21 in 2015, compared to $2.33 a year ago. The current and prior  year included expenses of $.25 and $.20 per share, respectively, from items impacting comparability as discussed below. The additional week contributed approximately $.08 per share to earnings from continuing operations in 2014.    \\n\\nEarnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2015 Compared with 2014\\n\\nThe following items impacted the comparability of earnings and earnings per share:\\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2015, we incurred charges associated with our initiatives to implement a new enterprise design, to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. We recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $102 million related to these initiatives. We also incurred pre-tax charges of $22 million recorded in Administrative expenses related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives (aggregate impact of $78 million after tax, or $.25 per share). See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information;   \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2014, we recognized pre-tax pension settlement charges in Cost of products sold of $22 million ($14 million after tax, or $.04 per share) associated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan\\'s assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in Sacramento, California;  \\n\\n15 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n•\\n\\nOn October 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our simple meals business in Europe. In 2014, we recorded a loss of $9 million ($6 million after tax, or $.02 per share) on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of our European simple meals business. The loss was included in Other expenses. In addition, we recorded tax expense of $7 million ($.02 per share) associated with the sale of the business;  \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2014, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $54 million ($33 million after tax, or $.10 per share) associated with initiatives to streamline our salaried workforce in North America and our workforce in the Asia Pacific region; restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in China; improve supply chain efficiency in Australia; and reduce overhead across the organization. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information; and  \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2013, we implemented several initiatives to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across our U.S. thermal plant network; expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico; improve our Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure; and reduce overhead in North America. In 2014, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $1 million and restructuring-related costs of $3 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $3 million after tax, or $.01 per share) related to the 2013 initiatives. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information.  \\n\\nThe items impacting comparability are summarized below:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014  \\n\\n(Millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\nEarnings\\n\\nImpact\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEPS\\n\\nImpact\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEarnings\\n\\nImpact\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nEPS\\n\\nImpact  \\n\\nEarnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company\\n\\n$\\n\\n691\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2.21\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n737\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2.33\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nRestructuring charges and related costs/implementation costs\\n\\n$\\n\\n(78\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(.25\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(36\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(.11\\n\\n)  \\n\\nPension settlement charges\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(14\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(.04\\n\\n)  \\n\\nLoss on foreign exchange forward contracts\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(6\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(.02\\n\\n)  \\n\\nTax expense associated with sale of business\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(7\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(.02\\n\\n)  \\n\\nImpact of items on earnings from continuing operations(1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n(78\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(.25\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(63\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(.20\\n\\n)  \\n\\n____________________________________\\n\\n(1)\\xa0\\n\\nThe sum of the individual per share amounts may not add due to rounding.  \\n\\nEarnings from continuing operations were $691 million ($2.21 per share) in 2015, compared to $737 million ($2.33 per share) in 2014. The additional week contributed approximately $25 million ($.08 per share) to earnings from continuing operations in 2014. After adjusting for the 53rd week and other items impacting comparability, earnings decreased primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage and the impact of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in sales on a constant currency basis, lower marketing and selling expenses, lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. Currency translation had a negative impact of $.06 on earnings per share in the current year. Earnings per share benefited from a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding, primarily due to share repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program.\\n\\nWe sold our European simple meals business on October 28, 2013. See \"Discontinued Operations\" for additional information. \\n\\nEarnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company - 2014 Compared with 2013\\n\\nIn addition to the 2014 items that impacted comparability of Earnings from continuing operations previously disclosed, the following items impacted the comparability of earnings and earnings per share:\\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2013, we implemented several initiatives to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across our U.S. thermal plant network; expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities in Mexico; improve our Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure; and reduce overhead in North America. In 2013, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $51 million and restructuring-related costs of $91 million in Cost of products sold (aggregate impact of $90 million after tax, or $.28 per share) related to the 2013 initiatives. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Restructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\" for additional information; and  \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn 2013, we incurred pre-tax transaction costs of $10 million ($7 million after tax, or $.02 per share) associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms, which closed on August 6, 2012.

The after-tax restructuring charge attributable to the noncontrolling interest was $5 million. \\n\\nWe also own a 70% controlling interest in a Malaysian food products manufacturing company. \\n\\nThe noncontrolling interests\\' share in the net earnings (loss) was included in Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \\n\\nDISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\\n\\nSales\\n\\nAn analysis of net sales by reportable segment follows:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n%\\xa0Change  \\n\\n(Millions)\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2013\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015/2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014/2013  \\n\\nU.S. Simple Meals\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,930\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,944\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,849\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3%  \\n\\nGlobal Baking and Snacking\\n\\n2,375\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2,440\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2,273\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7  \\n\\nInternational Simple Meals and Beverages\\n\\n700\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n780\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n869\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(10)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(10)  \\n\\nU.S. Beverages\\n\\n689\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n723\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n742\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(5)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)  \\n\\nBolthouse and Foodservice\\n\\n1,388\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1,381\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1,319\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n5  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,082\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,268\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n8,052\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3%  \\n\\n17 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAn analysis of percent change of net sales by reportable segment follows:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n2015 versus 2014\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\nSimple\\n\\nMeals\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGlobal\\n\\nBaking\\n\\nand\\n\\nSnacking\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nInternational\\n\\nSimple\\xa0Meals\\n\\nand\\n\\nBeverages (3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\nBeverages \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBolthouse and Foodservice (3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTotal (3)  \\n\\nVolume and Mix\\n\\n--%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--%  \\n\\nPrice and Sales Allowances\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1  \\n\\nIncreased Promotional Spending(1)\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--  \\n\\nCurrency\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(4)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(9)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)  \\n\\nNet Accounting(2)\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--  \\n\\nAcquisitions\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--  \\n\\nEstimated Impact of 53rd\\xa0week\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(10)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(5)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)%  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n2014 versus 2013\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\nSimple\\n\\nMeals\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nGlobal\\n\\nBaking\\n\\nand\\n\\nSnacking\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nInternational\\n\\nSimple\\xa0Meals\\n\\nand\\n\\nBeverages\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nU.S.\\n\\nBeverages (3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBolthouse and Foodservice\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTotal   \\n\\nVolume and Mix\\n\\n--%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(5)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--%  \\n\\nPrice and Sales Allowances\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1  \\n\\nDecreased/(Increased) Promotional Spending(1)\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2)  \\n\\nCurrency\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(6)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1)  \\n\\nNet Accounting(2)\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--  \\n\\nAcquisitions\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3  \\n\\nEstimated Impact of 53rd\\xa0week\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(10)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(3)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n5%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3%  \\n\\n__________________________________________\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nRepresents revenue reductions from trade promotion and consumer coupon redemption programs.  \\n\\n(2)\\n\\nBeginning in 2014, revenue in Mexico is presented on a net accounting basis in connection with a new business model under which the cost of certain services provided by our suppliers is netted against revenue.  \\n\\n(3)\\xa0\\n\\nSum of the individual amounts does not add due to rounding.  \\n\\nIn 2015, U.S. Simple Meals sales were comparable to the year-ago period. U.S. soup sales declined 3%, with 1% due to the impact of the 53rdweek. Further details of U.S. soup include: \\n\\n•\\n\\nSales of Campbell\\'s condensed soups decreased 3%, with declines in both eating and cooking varieties. Lower volumes were partially offset by higher selling prices and reduced promotional spending.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nSales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 5%.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nBroth sales increased 3% due to gains in aseptically-packaged broth, partially offset by declines in canned broth.  \\n\\nSales of other simple meals increased 5%, primarily due to growth in Prego pasta sauces, Plum products and Campbell\\'s dinner sauces, partially offset by lower sales in other simple meal products.\\n\\nIn 2014, U.S. Simple Meals sales increased 3%. U.S. soup sales decreased 1%. Excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, U.S. soup sales decreased 2%. Further details of U.S. soup, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, include: \\n\\n•\\n\\nSales of Campbell\\'s condensed soups decreased 3%, with declines in eating varieties partially offset by gains in cooking varieties. Lower volumes and increased promotional spending were partly offset by higher selling prices.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nSales of ready-to-serve soups decreased 6%, primarily due to declines in canned and microwavable soup varieties.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nBroth sales increased 8%, primarily due to more effective marketing programs, innovation and distribution gains.  \\n\\nSales of other simple meals increased 15%, primarily due to the acquisition of Plum in June 2013, which contributed 9 points of growth. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and the benefit of the 53rd week, sales increased due to gains in Prego pasta sauces, which benefited from the launch of Alfredo sauces; and Campbell\\'s dinner sauces, which benefited from the introduction in 2014 of Campbell\\'s Slow Cooker Sauces; partially offset by declines in Campbell\\'s canned gravy products.\\n\\n18 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn 2015, Global Baking and Snacking sales decreased 3%. In Arnott\\'s, sales decreased due to the impact of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, sales of Arnott\\'s products increased due to volume gains and higher selling prices in Australia and Indonesia. Pepperidge Farm sales declined primarily due to the impact of the 53rdweek. Excluding the impact of the 53rdweek, Pepperidge Farm sales increased due to gains in fresh bakery, and crackers and cookies, partially offset by declines in frozen products. \\n\\nIn 2014, Global Baking and Snacking sales increased 7%. The acquisition of Kelsen contributed $193 million to sales, or 8 points of growth. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and the benefit of the 53rd week, sales decreased primarily due to the  impact of currency translation. Excluding the  benefit of the 53rd week, Pepperidge Farm sales increased slightly with growth in fresh bakery and Goldfish crackers, partially offset by declines in adult cracker varieties and frozen products. In fresh bakery, sales increased due to gains in sandwich bread and rolls. In Arnott\\'s, sales decreased primarily due to the impact of currency translation and sales declines in Australia in savory and chocolate varieties, partially offset by strong gains in Indonesia and the benefit of the 53rd week. In 2014, we increased trade spending in Arnott\\'s and Pepperidge Farm to remain competitive.\\n\\nIn 2015, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 10%. In Canada, sales decreased due to the impact of currency translation and declines in beverages, partially offset by gains in baked snacks. In the Asia Pacific region, sales declined due to the  impact of currency translation and the 53rd week. In Latin America, sales declined due in part to the impact of presenting revenue on a net basis and currency translation. \\n\\nIn 2014, International Simple Meals and Beverages sales decreased 10%. In Canada, sales decreased due to the impact of currency translation and declines in beverages, partly offset by gains in snacks. In Latin America, sales declined due to the impact of presenting revenue on a net basis and lower selling prices in Mexico. In the Asia Pacific region, sales decreased primarily due to the impact of currency translation and declines in Australia, primarily in soup, partially offset by gains in Malaysia.\\n\\nIn 2015, U.S. Beverages, sales decreased 5%, primarily due to declines in V8 V-Fusion beverages and V8 vegetable juice, partially offset by gains in V8 Splash beverages. U.S. Beverages continued to be under pressure from category weakness in shelf-stable juices, as well as from competition from specialty beverages and packaged fresh juices.\\n\\nIn 2014, U.S. Beverages sales decreased 3%, primarily from declines in V8 V-Fusion multi-serve beverages and softness in single-serve beverages, due in part to the transition in 2014 to a new distribution network for the immediate consumption channel. U.S. Beverages continued to be under pressure from category weakness in shelf-stable juices, as well as from competition from specialty beverages and packaged fresh juices.\\n\\nIn 2015, Bolthouse and Foodservice sales increased 1%, primarily due to gains in Bolthouse premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings; and the acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet, which was acquired on June 29, 2015; partially offset by declines in Bolthouse carrots, juice concentrate and fiber. North America Foodservice sales were comparable, as volume gains and higher selling prices were offset by the impact of currency translation and the 53rdweek.\\n\\nIn 2014, Bolthouse and Foodservice sales increased 5%. The increase was due in part to the benefit of the 53rd week and the additional week of Bolthouse sales in 2014 as the business was acquired one week into 2013. Excluding the additional week of Bolthouse in 2014 and the benefit of the 53rd week, segment sales increased as gains in Bolthouse beverages and salad dressings were partially offset by declines in North America Foodservice. The North America Foodservice decline was due to volume declines in fresh soup sold at retail perimeter and the impact of currency translation. \\n\\n19 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nGross Profit\\n\\nGross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, decreased by $93 million in 2015 from 2014 and decreased by $14 million in 2014 from 2013. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 34.7% in 2015, 35.1% in 2014 and 36.2% in 2013. \\n\\nThe 0.4 and 1.1 percentage-point decreases in gross margin percentage in 2015 and 2014, respectively, were due to the following factors:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014  \\n\\nCost inflation, supply chain costs and other factors\\n\\n(2.7)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2.5)%  \\n\\nMix\\n\\n(0.3)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(0.4)  \\n\\nHigher level of promotional spending\\n\\n(0.1)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1.1)  \\n\\nReduction in restructuring-related costs\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1.1  \\n\\nImpact of acquisitions (including Plum recall in 2014)\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(0.6)  \\n\\nPension settlement charges in 2014(1)\\n\\n0.3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(0.3)  \\n\\nHigher selling prices\\n\\n0.5\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n0.7  \\n\\nProductivity improvements\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2.0  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(0.4)%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1.1)%  \\n\\n__________________________________________\\n\\n(1)\\xa0\\n\\nSee Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the pension settlement charges.  \\n\\nMarketing and Selling Expenses\\n\\nMarketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 10.9% in 2015, 11.3% in 2014 and 11.8% in 2013. Marketing and selling expenses decreased 6% in 2015 from 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of currency translation (approximately 2 percentage points); lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 2 percentage points); lower marketing overhead expenses (approximately 1 percentage point); and and lower selling expenses (approximately 1 percentage point). The decline in advertising expenses was primarily in U.S. Simple Meals and U.S. Beverages, partially offset by an increase in Global Baking and Snacking. Marketing and selling expenses decreased 1% in 2014 from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower advertising and consumer promotion expenses (approximately 2 percentage points); the impact of currency translation (approximately 1 percentage point); lower marketing overhead expenses (approximately 1 percentage point); and lower selling expenses (approximately 1 percentage point), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions (approximately 4 percentage points). \\n\\nAdministrative Expenses\\n\\nAdministrative expenses as a percent of sales were 7.3% in 2015, 6.9% in 2014 and 8.4% in 2013. Administrative expenses increased 3% in 2015 from 2014. The increase was primarily due to costs of $22 million in 2015 related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives (approximately 4 percentage points) and higher incentive compensation costs (approximately 4 percentage points),  partially offset by savings from cost reduction and restructuring initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points) and the impact of currency translation (approximately 2 percentage points). Administrative expenses decreased 15% in 2014 from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 13 percentage points); cost savings from restructuring initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points); and lower pension and other benefit expenses (approximately 2 percentage points), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions (approximately 3 percentage points). \\n\\nResearch and Development Expenses\\n\\nResearch and development expenses decreased $8 million, or 7%, in 2015 from 2014. The decrease was primarily due to savings from cost reduction and restructuring initiatives (approximately 7 percentage points). Research and development expenses decreased $7 million, or 5%, in 2014 from 2013. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs (approximately 4 percentage points) and cost savings from restructuring initiatives (approximately 3 percentage points), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions (approximately 3 percentage points). \\n\\nOther Expenses/(Income)\\n\\nOther expenses in 2015 included $17 million of amortization of intangible assets and an impairment charge of $6 million related to minor trademarks used in the Global Baking and Snacking segment. The impairment charge was recorded as a result of our annual review of intangible assets. Other expenses in 2014 included a loss of $9 million on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of the European simple meals business and $18 million of amortization of intangible assets. Other expenses in 2013 included $10 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms and $14 million of amortization of intangible assets. \\n\\n20 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOperating Earnings\\n\\nSegment operating earnings decreased 5% in 2015 from 2014.

The decrease was due to cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, and the impact of the 53rd week, partially offset by productivity improvements, lower marketing expenses, higher selling prices and the benefit of lapping the Plum recall in the prior year.\\n\\nEarnings from U.S. Simple Meals decreased 2% in 2014 versus 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage and expenses related to the Plum product recall in November 2013, partly offset by lower administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the additional week.\\n\\nEarnings from Global Baking and Snacking increased 5% in 2015 versus 2014. The increase was primarily due to productivity improvements, higher selling prices and sales volume gains, partially offset by cost inflation and higher supply chain costs, increased marketing expenses and the impact of currency translation. The operating earnings increase reflected improvement in Kelsen due to lapping the negative impact of purchase accounting in 2014 and growth in Pepperidge Farm, partly offset by lower earnings in Arnott\\'s, which were impacted by currency translation.\\n\\nEarnings from Global Baking and Snacking increased 5% in 2014 versus 2013. Operating earnings increased primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the Kelsen acquisition, lower marketing expenses and the benefit of the additional week, partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and the impact of currency translation. The operating earnings increase reflected growth in Pepperidge Farm and the addition of Kelsen\\'s operating results, partly offset by lower earnings in Arnott\\'s.\\n\\nEarnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased 25% in 2015 versus 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the adverse impact of currency movements on input costs and the impact of currency translation.\\n\\nEarnings from International Simple Meals and Beverages decreased 2% in 2014 versus 2013. The decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to lower sales volume and the impact of currency translation, partly offset by lower administrative expenses, a higher gross margin percentage and lower selling expenses.\\n\\nEarnings from U.S. Beverages decreased 11% in 2015 versus 2014, primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage and sales volume declines, partially offset by a reduction in marketing expenses.\\n\\nEarnings from U.S. Beverages increased 6% in 2014 versus 2013, primarily due to lower administrative and marketing expenses, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and sales volume declines.\\n\\nEarnings from Bolthouse and Foodservice decreased 9% in 2015 versus 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a lower gross margin percentage in Bolthouse carrots, juice concentrate and fiber, reflecting higher carrot costs due in part to adverse weather, partly offset by an improvement in gross margin percentage in Bolthouse premium refrigerated beverages and salad dressings, reflecting lower promotional spending.\\n\\nEarnings from Bolthouse and Foodservice increased 1% in 2014 versus 2013. The increase was primarily due to lower administrative expenses, the increase in sales and the benefit of the 53rd week, partly offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased marketing investment for Bolthouse Farms.\\n\\nUnallocated corporate expenses in 2015 included costs of $22 million related to the implementation of our new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives. Unallocated corporate expenses in 2014 included pension settlement charges of $22 million \\n\\n21 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nassociated with a U.S. pension plan. The settlements resulted from the level of lump sum distributions from the plan\\'s assets in 2014, primarily due to the closure of the facility in Sacramento, California. In addition, 2014 included a $9 million loss on foreign exchange forward contracts related to the sale of the European simple meals business and $3 million of restructuring-related costs. The remaining change was primarily due to lower losses on open commodity hedges in 2015. Unallocated corporate expenses in 2013 included $91 million of restructuring-related costs and $10 million of transaction costs associated with the Bolthouse Farms acquisition. The remaining decrease in expenses in 2014 from 2013 was primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and gains on foreign exchange transactions. \\n\\nInterest Expense/Income\\n\\nInterest expense decreased to $108 million in 2015 from $122 million in 2014, reflecting lower average levels of debt.\\n\\nInterest expense decreased to $122 million in 2014 from $135 million in 2013, reflecting lower interest rates on the debt portfolio. Interest income decreased to $3 million from $10 million in 2013, primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents.\\n\\nTaxes on Earnings\\n\\nThe effective tax rate was 30.2% in 2015, 32.3% in 2014 and 28.8% in 2013. In 2015, we recognized a tax benefit of $46 million on $124 million of restructuring charges and implementation costs. In 2014, we recognized a tax benefit of $8 million on $22 million of pension settlement charges associated with a U.S. pension plan. In addition, 2014 also included a tax benefit of $17 million on $58 million of restructuring charges and related costs, a tax expense of $7 million associated with the sale of the European simple meals business and a tax benefit of $3 million on a loss of $9 million on foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge the proceeds from the sale of the business. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the remaining decrease in the effective rate in 2015 was primarily due to the favorable resolution of an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada.\\n\\nIn 2013, we recognized a tax benefit of $55 million on $152 million of restructuring charges and related costs and acquisition transaction costs. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the remaining increase in the effective rate in 2014 was primarily due to the 2013 rate benefiting from lower taxes on foreign earnings and the favorable settlement of state tax matters.\\n\\nRestructuring Charges and Cost Savings Initiatives\\n\\n2015 Initiatives\\n\\nOn January 29, 2015, we announced plans to implement a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. Under the new design, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are organized in the following divisions: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh. \\n\\nIn support of the new enterprise design, we designed and implemented a new IGS organization to deliver shared services across the company. IGS, which became effective at the beginning of 2016, is expected to reduce costs while increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. We are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organizational structure and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. \\n\\nAs part of these initiatives, we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain U.S.-based salaried employees nearing retirement who met age, length-of-service and business unit/function criteria. A total of 471 employees elected the program. The electing employees remained with us through July 31, 2015, with some remaining beyond July 31. We also implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 230 positions. In 2015, we recorded a restructuring charge of $102 million related to these initiatives.\\n\\nFinally, we incurred charges of $22 million recorded in Administrative expenses related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives. \\n\\nThe aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and implementation and other costs recorded in 2015 was $78 million, or $.25 per share. A summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2015 initiatives is as follows:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n(Millions)\\n\\nRecognized  \\nas of  \\nAugust 2, 2015  \\n\\nSeverance pay and benefits\\n\\n$\\n\\n94\\n\\nImplementation and other costs\\n\\n30\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n124\\n\\nThe total estimated pre-tax costs for the 2015 initiatives are approximately $250 million to $325 million. We expect the costs to consist of approximately $150 million to $163 million in severance pay and benefits, and approximately $100 million to $162 million in implementation and other costs.We expect the total pre-tax costs related to the 2015 initiatives will be associated with \\n\\n22 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nsegments as follows: U.S. Simple Meals - approximately 21%; Global Baking and Snacking - approximately 28%; International Simple Meals and Beverages - approximately 6%; U.S. Beverages - approximately 5%; Bolthouse and Foodservice - approximately 5%; and Corporate - approximately 35%. \\n\\nWe expect substantially all costs to be cash expenditures, except for $7 million of non-cash postretirement and pension curtailment costs. We expect to incur the costs through 2018, and fund the costs through cash and short-term borrowings. \\n\\nWe expect the 2015 initiatives to generate pre-tax savings of approximately $145 million in 2016, and once fully implemented, annual ongoing savings of approximately $250 million beginning in 2018. In 2015, pre-tax savings were $85 million.\\n\\nSegment operating results do not include restructuring charges and implementation and other costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges.

Details of the 2014 initiatives include:\\n\\n•\\n\\nWe streamlined our salaried workforce in North America and our workforce in the Asia Pacific region. Approximately 250 positions were eliminated.   \\n\\n•\\n\\nTogether with our joint venture partner Swire Pacific Limited, we restructured manufacturing and streamlined operations for our soup and broth business in China. As a result, certain assets were impaired, and approximately 100 positions were eliminated.   \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn Australia, we implemented an initiative to improve supply chain efficiency by relocating production from our biscuit plant in Marleston to Huntingwood. The relocation will continue through 2017 and will result in the elimination of approximately 90 positions.   \\n\\n•\\n\\nWe implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 85 positions. The actions were completed in 2015.  \\n\\nIn 2014, we recorded a restructuring charge of $54 million ($33 million after tax, or $.10 per share, in earnings from continuing operations attributable to Campbell Soup Company) related to the 2014 initiatives. \\n\\nA summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2014 initiatives is as follows:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n(Millions)\\n\\nTotal Program  \\n\\nSeverance pay and benefits\\n\\n$\\n\\n41\\n\\nAsset impairment\\n\\n12\\n\\nOther exit costs\\n\\n1\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n54\\n\\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2015, we incurred substantially all of the costs related to the 2014 initiatives. Of the aggregate $54 million of pre-tax costs, approximately $41 million represented cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $6 million in capital expenditures, primarily to relocate biscuit production and packaging capabilities, of which we invested approximately $3 million as of August 2, 2015. We do not expect the remaining cash outflows related to these restructuring initiatives to have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\\n\\nThe 2014 initiatives generated pre-tax savings of approximately $26 million in 2014 and $57 million in 2015. We expect to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $65 million beginning in 2016. \\n\\nSegment operating results do not include restructuring charges because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. The total pre-tax costs of $54 million associated with segments were as follows: U.S. Simple Meals - $8 million; Global Baking and Snacking - $23 million; International Simple Meals and Beverages - $18 million; U.S. Beverages - $2 million; Bolthouse and Foodservice - $2 million; and Corporate - $1 million. \\n\\n23 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n2013 Initiatives\\n\\nIn 2013, we implemented initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency, expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities and reduce costs. Details of the 2013 initiatives include:\\n\\n•\\n\\nWe implemented initiatives to improve our U.S. supply chain cost structure and increase asset utilization across our U.S. thermal plant network, including closing our Sacramento, California, thermal plant, which produced soups, sauces and beverages. The closure resulted in the elimination of approximately 700 full-time positions and was completed in phases. Most of the positions were eliminated in 2013, and operations ceased in August 2013. We shifted the majority of Sacramento\\'s soup, sauce and beverage production to our thermal plants in Maxton, North Carolina; Napoleon, Ohio; and Paris, Texas. We also closed our South Plainfield, New Jersey, spice plant, which resulted in the elimination of 27 positions. We consolidated spice production at our Milwaukee, Wisconsin, plant in 2013.    \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn Mexico, we entered into commercial arrangements with third-party providers to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The third-party providers produce and distribute our beverages, soups, broths and sauces throughout the Mexican market. As a result of these agreements, we closed our plant in Villagran, Mexico, and eliminated approximately 260 positions in the first quarter of 2014.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nWe implemented an initiative to improve our Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure by closing our plant in Aiken, South Carolina. The plant was closed in May 2014. We shifted the majority of Aiken\\'s bread production to our bakery plant in Lakeland, Florida. Approximately 110 positions were eliminated as a result of the plant closure.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nWe streamlined our salaried workforce in U.S. Simple Meals, North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages by approximately 70 positions. This action was substantially completed in August 2013.   \\n\\nIn 2014, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1 million related to the 2013 initiatives. In addition, we recorded approximately $3 million of costs related to the 2013 initiatives in Cost of products sold, representing other exit costs. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs recorded in 2014 was $3 million, or $.01 per share. In 2013, we recorded a restructuring charge of $51 million. In addition, we recorded approximately $91 million of costs related to these initiatives in 2013 in Cost of products sold, representing accelerated depreciation and other exit costs. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs recorded in 2013 was $90 million, or $.28 per share. \\n\\nA summary of the pre-tax costs associated with the 2013 initiatives is as follows:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n(Millions)\\n\\nTotal Program  \\n\\nSeverance pay and benefits\\n\\n$\\n\\n35\\n\\nAccelerated depreciation/asset impairment\\n\\n99\\n\\nOther exit costs\\n\\n12\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n$\\n\\n146\\n\\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2015, we substantially completed the 2013 initiatives. Of the aggregate $146 million of pre-tax costs, approximately $43 million represented cash expenditures. In addition, we invested approximately $30 million in capital expenditures as of August\\xa02, 2015, primarily to relocate and refurbish a beverage filling and packaging line, and relocate bread production. \\n\\nBeginning in 2015, the 2013 initiatives generated annual ongoing pre-tax savings of approximately $40 million. In 2014, savings were approximately $30 million.\\n\\nSegment operating results do not include restructuring charges and related costs because we evaluate segment performance excluding such charges. The total pre-tax costs of $146 million associated with segments were as follows: U.S. Simple Meals - $90 million; Global Baking and Snacking - $14 million; International Simple Meals and Beverages - $9 million; U.S. Beverages - $31 million; and Bolthouse and Foodservice - $2 million. \\n\\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\n\\nDiscontinued Operations\\n\\nOn October 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our European simple meals business to Soppa Investments S.a r.l., an affiliate of CVC Capital Partners. The all-cash preliminary sale price was €400 million, or $548 million, and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 million reduction of proceeds. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $141 million ($72 million after tax, or $.23 per share) in 2014. \\n\\nWe have reflected the results of the European simple meals business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.\\n\\n24 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nResults of discontinued operations were as follows:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n(Millions)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2013\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nNet sales\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n137\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n532\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nGain on sale of the European simple meals business\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n141\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nImpairment on the European simple meals business\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(396\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nEarnings from operations, before taxes\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nEarnings (loss) before taxes\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n155\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(331\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nTaxes on earnings\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(74\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n100\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nEarnings (loss) from discontinued operations\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n81\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(231\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an impairment charge on the intangible assets of this business of $396 million ($263 million after tax, or $.83 per share). In addition, we recorded $18 million in tax expense ($.06 per share) representing taxes on the difference between the book value and tax basis of the business. See also Notes 4 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\n\\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n\\nWe expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, including commercial paper; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements. \\n\\nWe generated cash from operations of $1.182 billion\\xa0in 2015, compared to $899 million in 2014. The increase in 2015 was primarily due to lower working capital requirements, taxes paid in 2014 on the divestiture of the European simple meals business and lower pension contributions in 2015, partially offset by lower cash earnings.\\n\\nWe generated cash from operations of $899 million\\xa0in 2014, compared to $1.019 billion in 2013. The decrease in 2014 was primarily due to lower cash earnings and taxes paid on the divestiture of the European simple meals business, partly offset by lower working capital requirements.\\n\\nCapital expenditures were $380 million\\xa0in 2015, $347 million in 2014 and $336 million in 2013. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $350 million in 2016. Capital expenditures in 2015 included a cracker capacity expansion at Pepperidge Farm (approximately $36\\xa0million); a Bolthouse Farms beverage and salad dressing capacity expansion project (approximately $33 million); the ongoing initiative to simplify the soup-making process in North America (also known as the soup common platform initiative) (approximately $30 million); a Bolthouse Farms warehouse capacity expansion project (approximately $13 million); biscuit capacity expansion in Indonesia (approximately $13 million); continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $12 million); and aseptic broth capacity expansion (approximately $6 million). Capital expenditures in 2014 included capacity expansion at Pepperidge Farm (approximately $48 million); the ongoing soup common platform initiative in North America (approximately $22 million); broth capacity expansion (approximately $15 million); continued enhancement of our corporate headquarters (approximately $12 million); a flexible beverage production line for Bolthouse Farms (approximately $11 million); the refurbishment of a beverage filling and packaging line for the U.S. Beverages business (approximately $10 million); the packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of our Australian biscuit plants (approximately $10 million); and an advanced planning system in North America (approximately $4 million). Capital expenditures in 2013 included the soup capacity expansion project for the North America Foodservice business (approximately $42 million); capacity expansion at Pepperidge Farm (approximately $38 million); the ongoing soup common platform initiative in North America (approximately $20 million); the packing automation and capacity expansion projects at one of our Australian biscuit plants (approximately $19 million); and an advanced planning system in North America (approximately $11 million). \\n\\nOn June 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet. The purchase price was $232 million, subject to post-closing adjustments, and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.\\n\\nOn August 8, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Kelsen. The final all-cash purchase price was $331 million and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.\\n\\nOn June 13, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Plum. The final all-cash purchase price was $249 million, and was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.\\n\\nIn March 2015, we issued $300 million of 3.30% notes that mature on March\\xa019, 2025. Interest on the notes is due semi-annually on March 19 and September 19, commencing on September 19, 2015. The notes may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at our option at any time at the applicable redemption price. In certain circumstances, we may be required to repurchase some or \\n\\n25 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nall of the notes upon a change in control of our company and a downgrade of the notes below investment grade. The net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\\n\\nLong-term borrowings in 2013 included:\\n\\n•\\n\\n$400 million floating rate notes that matured on August 1, 2014. Interest on the notes was based on 3-month U.S. dollar LIBOR plus 0.30%. Interest was payable quarterly and commenced on November 1, 2012;  \\n\\n•\\n\\n$450 million of  2.50% notes that mature on August 2, 2022. Interest is payable semi-annually and commenced on February 2, 2013. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption; and  \\n\\n•\\n\\n$400 million of  3.80% notes that mature on August 2, 2042. Interest is payable semi-annually and commenced on February 2, 2013. We may redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the note holders are not penalized by the early redemption.  \\n\\nThe net proceeds from these issuances were used to fund the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms in 2013 for $1.561 billion. The balance of the purchase price was funded through the issuance of commercial paper.\\n\\nDividend payments were $394 million in 2015, $391 million in 2014 and $367 million in 2013. Annual dividends declared were $1.248 per share in 2015 and 2014 and $1.16 per share in 2013. The 2015 fourth quarter rate was $.312 per share.\\n\\nWe repurchased approximately 5 million shares at a cost of $244 million in 2015, approximately 2 million shares at a cost of $76 million in 2014, and approximately 4 million shares at a cost of $153 million in 2013. In June 2011, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $1 billion of our stock. Of the amount spent in 2015, $200 million was used to repurchase shares pursuant to our June 2011 publicly announced share repurchase program. Approximately $550 million remained available to repurchase shares under our June\\xa02011 repurchase program as of August\\xa02, 2015. The program has no expiration date. We also expect to continue our longstanding practice, under separate authorization, of purchasing shares sufficient to offset shares issued under incentive compensation plans. See \"Market for Registrant\\'s Capital Stock, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\" for more information. \\n\\nAt August\\xa02, 2015, we had $1.543 billion of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $1.532 billion was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of August\\xa02, 2015, we issued $50 million of standby letters of credit. We have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $2.2 billion that matures in December 2018. This facility remained unused at August\\xa02, 2015, except for $3 million\\xa0of standby letters of credit that we issued under it.\\xa0This revolving credit facility supports our commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes. We may also increase the commitment under the credit facility up to an additional $500 million, upon the agreement of either existing lenders or of additional banks not currently parties to the existing credit agreements.\\n\\nOn October 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our European simple meals business to Soppa Investments S.a r.l., an affiliate of CVC Capital Partners, for €400 million, or $548 million. The sale price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 million reduction of proceeds. We used the proceeds from the sale to pay taxes on the sale, to reduce debt and for other general corporate purposes.\\n\\nIn September 2014, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement, we may issue debt securities, depending on market conditions.\\n\\nWe are in compliance with the covenants contained in our revolving credit facilities and debt securities.\\n\\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS\\n\\nContractual Obligations \\n\\nThe following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contractual obligations as of August\\xa02, 2015. For additional information on debt, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are primarily entered into for warehouse and office facilities and certain equipment. Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment and services. These commitments are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity. Other long-term liabilities primarily represent payments related to deferred compensation obligations. For additional information on other long-term liabilities, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\n26 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nContractual Payments Due by Fiscal Year  \\n\\n(Millions)\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2016\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2017-2018\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2019-2020\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThereafter  \\n\\nDebt obligations(1)\\n\\n$\\n\\n4,103\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,543\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n402\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n301\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,857\\n\\nInterest payments(2)\\n\\n885\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n103\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n190\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n159\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n433\\n\\nDerivative payments(3)\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nPurchase commitments\\n\\n1,004\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n778\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n97\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n53\\n\\nOperating leases\\n\\n139\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n21\\n\\nOther long-term payments(4)\\n\\n212\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n103\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n72\\n\\nTotal long-term cash obligations\\n\\n$\\n\\n6,363\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,474\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n848\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n605\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n2,436\\n\\n_______________________________________\\n\\n(1)\\xa0\\n\\nExcludes unamortized net discount/premium on debt issuances.

For additional information on pension and postretirement benefits, see Note\\xa011 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on unrecognized tax benefits, see Note\\xa012 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \\n\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments \\n\\nWe guarantee approximately 2,000 bank loans to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third-party financial institutions used to purchase distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $192 million. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. See also Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on off-balance sheet arrangements. \\n\\nINFLATION\\n\\nIn 2015, inflation in cost of products sold was higher than 2014, and 2014 was higher than 2013. We continue to use a number of strategies to mitigate the effects of cost inflation including increasing prices, commodity hedging and pursuing cost productivity initiatives such as global procurement strategies and capital investments that improve the efficiency of operations.\\n\\nMARKET RISK SENSITIVITY\\n\\nThe principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. International operations, which accounted for 21% of  2015 net sales, are concentrated principally in Australia and Canada. We manage our foreign currency exposures by borrowing in various foreign currencies and utilizing cross-currency swaps and forward contracts. We enter into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. \\n\\nWe principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, soybean oil, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa, butter, corn and cheese, which impact the cost of raw materials.\\n\\nThe information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments as of August\\xa02, 2015. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13 through 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \\n\\n27 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe following table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for debt obligations. Interest rates disclosed on variable-rate debt  represent the weighted-average rates at August\\xa02, 2015. Notional amounts and related interest rates of interest rate swaps are presented by fiscal year of maturity.

The total notional value of forward exchange contracts outstanding was $260 million, and the aggregate fair value was a loss of $1 million as of August\\xa03, 2014. \\n\\nWe enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. The notional value of these contracts was $95 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $9 million as of August\\xa02, 2015. The notional value of these contracts was $146 million, and the aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $9 million as of August\\xa03, 2014. \\n\\nWe enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return on our capital stock was $17 million at August\\xa02, 2015, and $25 million at August\\xa03, 2014. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in April 2016, was 0.80% at August\\xa02, 2015. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the return on the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index was $24 million at August\\xa02, 2015, and $22 million at August\\xa03, 2014. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2016, was 0.79% at August\\xa02, 2015. The notional value of the contract that is linked to the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index was $8 million at August\\xa02, 2015, and $9 million at August\\xa03, 2014. The average forward interest rate applicable to this contract, which expires in March 2016, was 0.71% at August\\xa02, 2015. The fair value of these contracts was a $1 million gain at August\\xa02, 2015, and a $3 million loss at August\\xa03, 2014. \\n\\nOur utilization of financial instruments in managing market risk exposures described above is consistent with the prior year. Changes in the portfolio of financial instruments are a function of the results of operations, debt repayment and debt issuances, market effects on debt and foreign currency, and our acquisition and divestiture activities. \\n\\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\n\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: \\n\\nTrade and consumer promotion programs -- We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees, and coupons. The mix between promotion programs, which are classified as reductions in revenue, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans, and such fluctuations have an impact on revenues. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. \\n\\nValuation of long-lived assets -- Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow \\n\\n29 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nanalyses are used to determine if impairment exists. If impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value. \\n\\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that more likely than not the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the \"implied\" fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination. \\n\\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value. \\n\\nAs of August\\xa02, 2015, the carrying value of goodwill was $2,344 million. Recent acquisitions include Garden Fresh Gourmet on June 29, 2015,  Kelsen in 2014, and Plum and Bolthouse Farms in 2013. As of August\\xa02, 2015, goodwill related to the acquisitions was as follows: Garden Fresh Gourmet - $116 million, Kelsen - $115 million, Plum - $128 million and Bolthouse Farms - $692 million. As of the 2015 measurement, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value, excluding the recent acquisitions. Holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in the carrying value of any reporting unit, excluding the recent acquisitions, to be in excess of the fair value. Because the Garden Fresh Gourmet acquisition closed on June 29, 2015, the carrying value represents fair value. With respect to the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by at least 7% and as a result, holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 fair value measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would result in the carrying value to be in excess of the fair value. The fair value was based on significant management assumptions. If assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result.\\n\\nAs of August\\xa02, 2015, the carrying value of indefinite-lived trademarks was $960 million. As of August\\xa02, 2015, trademarks related to the acquisitions in 2013 through 2015 were as follows: Garden Fresh Gourmet - $38 million, Kelsen - $120 million, Plum - $115 million and Bolthouse Farms - $383 million. Excluding the Garden Fresh Gourmet trademark acquired on June 29, 2015, holding all other assumptions used in the 2015 measurement constant, a 100-basis-point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value of trademarks, and result in an impairment charge of approximately $20 million. \\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $6 million on minor trademarks used in the Global Baking and Snacking segment. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recorded an impairment charge of $360 million on goodwill and $36 million on trademarks for the simple meals business in Europe. The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management\\'s assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. On October\\xa028, 2013, we completed the sale of our European simple meals business. We have reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment.  See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on discontinued operations.\\n\\nThe estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions, and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management\\'s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance, and economic conditions. \\n\\nSee also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets. \\n\\nPension and postretirement benefits -- We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected \\n\\n30 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nreturn on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are generally accumulated and amortized over future periods. \\n\\nThe discount rate is established as of our fiscal year-end measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. The value of plan assets, used in the calculation of pension expense, is determined on a calculated method that recognizes 20% of the difference between the actual fair value of assets and the expected calculated method.  Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. If the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion is amortized into earnings in the following year. \\n\\nNet periodic pension and postretirement expense was $80 million in 2015, $109 million in 2014 and $130 million in 2013. \\n\\nSignificant weighted-average assumptions as of the end of the year were as follows:   \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2013  \\n\\nPension\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nDiscount rate for benefit obligations\\n\\n4.19%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.33%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.82%  \\n\\nExpected return on plan assets\\n\\n7.35%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7.62%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7.62%  \\n\\nPostretirement\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nDiscount rate for obligations\\n\\n4.00%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.00%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.50%  \\n\\nInitial health care trend rate\\n\\n7.75%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n8.25%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n8.25%  \\n\\nUltimate health care trend rate\\n\\n4.50%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.50%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.50%  \\n\\nEstimated sensitivities to annual net periodic pension cost are as follows: a 50-basis-point reduction in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $14 million; a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would increase expense by approximately $11 million. A one-percentage-point increase in assumed health care costs would increase postretirement service and interest cost by approximately $1 million. \\n\\nNo contributions were made to U.S. pension plans in 2015. We contributed $35 million and $75 million, respectively, to U.S. pension plans in 2014 and 2013. Contributions to non-U.S. plans were $5 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014 and 2013. We do not expect to contribute to the U.S. pension plans in 2016. Contributions to non-U.S. plans are expected to be approximately $5 million in 2016.\\n\\nSee also Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expenses. \\n\\nIncome taxes -- The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management\\'s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. \\n\\nSee also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes. \\n\\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\\n\\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements.\\n\\nCAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\\n\\nThis Report contains \"forward-looking\" statements that reflect our current expectations regarding our future results of operations, economic performance, financial condition and achievements.

accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\n37 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\n(currency in millions, except per share amounts)\\n\\n1.\\n\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies  \\n\\nIn this Form 10-K, unless otherwise stated, the terms \"we,\" \"us\", \"our\" and the \"company\" refer to Campbell Soup Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. \\n\\nWe are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded convenience food products.\\n\\nBasis of Presentation\\xa0-- The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and entities in which we maintain a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior-year financial statements were reclassified to conform to the current-year presentation. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July\\xa031. There were 52 weeks in 2015 and 2013, and 53 weeks in 2014.\\n\\nUse of Estimates\\xa0-- Generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\xa0-- Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete. This occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements, title and risk of loss transfer to customers, collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable. Revenues are recognized net of provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Certain sales promotion expenses, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupon redemption costs, are classified as a reduction of sales. The recognition of costs for promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Costs are recognized either upon sale or when the incentive is offered, based on the program. Revenues are presented on a net basis for arrangements under which suppliers perform certain additional services.\\n\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\xa0-- All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.\\n\\nInventories\\xa0-- All inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market.\\n\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\xa0-- Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods not exceeding\\xa045 years\\xa0and\\xa020 years, respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes in business climate or a plan of disposal. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.\\n\\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\\xa0-- Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually for impairment, or when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a two-step quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a two-step quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the \"implied\" fair value, which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and accounted for as a business combination.\\n\\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the asset is reduced to fair value.\\n\\nSee Note 6 for information on intangible assets and impairment charges recognized in 2013 and 2015.\\n\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\xa0-- We use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee benefit obligations. We enter into these derivative contracts for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. Our derivative programs include strategies that qualify and strategies that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated.\\xa0\\n\\n38 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nAll derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, on the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (fair-value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge), or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item) and are not designated for hedge accounting.\\n\\nChanges in the fair value of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings. The effective portion of gains and losses on cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. If the hedge is no longer effective, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are included in earnings each period until the instrument matures. If a derivative is used as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value, to the extent effective as a hedge, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Any ineffective portion of designated hedges is recognized in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized in current-period earnings.\\n\\nCash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash provided by operating activities.\\n\\nAdvertising Production Costs -- Advertising production costs are expensed in the period that the advertisement first takes place or when a decision is made not to use an advertisement. \\n\\nResearch and Development Costs\\xa0-- The costs of research and development are expensed as incurred. Costs include expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and improvements to existing products and processes. Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting, and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\xa0-- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. \\n\\n2.\\n\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements  \\n\\nIn December 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to disclosures about offsetting (netting) of assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position. The guidance requires entities to disclose gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions that are offset in the statement of financial position, and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. The scope includes financial instruments and derivative instruments. In January 2013, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance to limit the scope of the new balance sheet offsetting disclosures to derivatives, repurchase agreements, and securities lending transactions to the extent that they are offset in the financial statements or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar arrangement. The disclosures were required for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We adopted the guidance in 2014. The adoption resulted in additional disclosures, but did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 14.\\n\\nIn July 2012, the FASB issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The amendments will allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. An entity will no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative test unless the entity determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The amendments were effective for annual and interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September\\xa015, 2012. We adopted the guidance in 2014. The adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount is fixed. Such obligations may include debt arrangements, legal settlements, and other contractual arrangements. The guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for those obligations within scope that existed as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We adopted the guidance in 2015. The adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn March 2013, the FASB issued guidance on the accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The guidance was effective prospectively for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. We adopted the guidance in 2015. The adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\n39 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn July 2013, the FASB issued guidance on the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The guidance requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carryforward that would apply in settlement of uncertain tax positions.  Under the new standard, UTBs will be netted against all available same-jurisdiction loss or other tax carryforwards that would be utilized, rather than only against carryforwards that are created by the UTBs. The guidance was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013, and should be applied prospectively to all UTBs that exist at the effective date. We adopted the guidance in 2015. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn April 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance that modifies the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and requires additional disclosures. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted.  We will prospectively apply the guidance to applicable transactions. \\n\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance on the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is designed to create greater comparability for financial statement users across industries and jurisdictions. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures. The guidance was originally effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue guidance by one year to fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Entities will be permitted to adopt the new revenue standard early, but not before the original effective date. The guidance permits the use of either a full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements, as well as which transition method we will use. \\n\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the balance sheet as a reduction from the carrying value of the associated debt liability, consistent with the presentation of a debt discount. The guidance must be applied on a retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued guidance intended to provide a practical expedient for the measurement date of defined benefit plan assets and obligations. The practical expedient allows employers with fiscal year-end dates that do not fall on a calendar month-end to measure pension and postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations as of the calendar month-end date closest to the fiscal year-end.The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the guidance in connection with our 2015 measurement. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued guidance to clarify the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a  cloud computing arrangement. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. The new guidance should be applied either prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified after the effective date or retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nIn May 2015, the FASB issued guidance that eliminates the requirement to categorize investments measured using the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient in the fair value hierarchy table. Entities will be required to disclose the fair value of investments measured using the NAV practical expedient so that financial statement users can reconcile amounts reported in the fair value hierarchy table to amounts reported on the balance sheet. The new guidance will be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the guidance in 2015 and modified our disclosures in Note 11.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nAcquisitions  \\n\\nOn June 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Garden Fresh Gourmet for $232, subject to post-closing adjustments. Garden Fresh Gourmet is a provider of refrigerated salsa in North America, and it is also produces hummus, dips and tortilla chips. \\n\\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of identifiable net assets was recorded as $116 of goodwill. The goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities, anticipated synergies, and intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet contributed $10 to Net sales and resulted in a decrease of $1 to Net earnings from June 29, 2015, through August 2, 2015.\\n\\n40 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nOn August 8, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Kelsen. The final all-cash purchase price was  $331. Kelsen is a producer of quality baked snacks that are sold in approximately 85 countries around the world. Its primary brands include Kjeldsens and Royal Dansk. \\n\\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of identifiable net assets was recorded as $140 of goodwill. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the Global Baking and Snacking segment.\\n\\nThe acquisition of Kelsen contributed $193 to Net sales and $8 to Net earnings from August 8, 2013, through August 3, 2014.\\n\\nOn June 13, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Plum. The final all-cash purchase price was $249. Plum is a leading provider of premium, organic foods and snacks that serve the nutritional needs of babies, toddlers and children. \\n\\nThe acquisition of Plum contributed $88 to Net sales and resulted in a decrease of $19 to Net earnings for 2014. The 2014 results included  $11of after-tax costs incurred from a voluntary product recall (see Note 20 for additional details).  The acquisition also contributed $14 to Net sales and resulted in a decrease of $2 to Net earnings from June 13, 2013, through July 28, 2013.\\n\\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of identifiable net assets was recorded as $128 of goodwill. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill was primarily attributable to future growth opportunities and intangible assets that did not qualify for separate recognition. The goodwill is included in the U.S. Simple Meals segment. \\n\\nOn August 6, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms from a fund managed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity firm, for $1,550 in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. On August 6, 2012, the preliminary purchase price adjustments resulted in an increase in the purchase price of $20. In the third quarter of 2013, the purchase price adjustments were finalized and reduced to $11. Bolthouse Farms is a vertically integrated food and beverage company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing fresh carrots and proprietary, high value-added products. \\n\\nThe acquisition of Bolthouse Farms contributed $756 to Net sales and $18 to Net earnings from August 6, 2012 through July\\xa028, 2013. The company incurred transaction costs of $10 ($7 after tax) in the first quarter of 2013 related to this acquisition. The costs were recorded in Other expenses/(income).\\n\\nThe excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of identifiable net assets was recorded as $692 of goodwill. Of this amount, $284 is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

The all-cash preliminary sale price was €400, or $548, and was subject to certain post-closing adjustments, which resulted in a $14 reduction of proceeds. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $141 ($72 after tax, or $.23 per share) in 2014. The European business included Erasco and Heisse Tasse soups in Germany; Liebig and Royco soups in France; Devos Lemmens mayonnaise and cold sauces and Royco soups in Belgium; and Bla Band and Isomitta soups and sauces in Sweden. We used the proceeds from the sale to pay taxes on the sale, to reduce debt and for other general corporate purposes.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, we recorded an impairment charge on the intangible assets of this business of $396 ($263 after tax, or $.83 per share). In addition, we recorded $18 in tax expense ($.06 per share) representing taxes on the difference between the book value and tax basis of the business.

The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July\\xa028, 2013. We have reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $360 was recorded on goodwill for the simple meals business in Europe to reduce the carrying value to the implied fair value of $110. The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in \\n\\n44 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nthe region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management\\'s assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. The impairment charge was recorded in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\\n\\nIntangible Assets\\n\\nThe following table sets forth balance sheet information for intangible assets, excluding goodwill, subject to amortization and intangible assets not subject to amortization:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nIntangible Assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014  \\n\\nAmortizable intangible assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nCustomer relationships\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n222\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n178\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n40\\n\\nOther\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n35\\n\\nTotal gross amortizable intangible assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n297\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n253\\n\\nAccumulated amortization\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(52\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(35\\n\\n)  \\n\\nTotal net amortizable intangible assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n245\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n218\\n\\nNon-amortizable intangible assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nTrademarks\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n960\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n957\\n\\nTotal net intangible assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,205\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,175\\n\\nNon-amortizable intangible assets consist of trademarks, which include Bolthouse Farms, Pace, Plum, Kjeldsens, Garden Fresh Gourmet and Royal Dansk. Other amortizable intangible assets consist of recipes, patents, trademarks and distributor relationships. \\n\\nAmortization of intangible assets of continuing operations was $17 for 2015, $18 for 2014 and $14 for 2013. Amortization expense for the next 5 years is estimated to be $20 in the fiscal periods 2016 and 2017, and $15 in 2018 through 2020. Asset useful lives range from 5 to 20 years.\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $6 related to minor trademarks used in the Global Baking and Snacking segment. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows in comparison to the prior year. The impairment charge was recorded in Other expenses/(income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $36 related to certain trademarks of the European business held for sale, including Royco, Isomitta and Heisse Tasse. The trademarks were determined to be impaired as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the brands, resulting from reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows as previously discussed. The impairment charge was recorded in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\\n\\nThe discounted estimates of future cash flows used in determining the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management\\'s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nBusiness and Geographic Segment Information  \\n\\nThrough 2015, we managed operations through 11 operating segments based on product type and geographic location and have aggregated the operating segments into the appropriate reportable segment based on similar economic characteristics; products; production processes; types or classes of customers; distribution methods; and regulatory environment. The reportable segments are discussed in greater detail below.\\n\\nThe U.S.\\xa0Simple Meals segment includes the following products: Campbell\\'s condensed and ready-to-serve soups; Swanson broth and stocks; Prego pasta sauces; Pace Mexican sauces; Campbell\\'s gravies, pasta, beans and dinner sauces; Swanson canned poultry; and as of June 13, 2013, Plum food and snacks.\\n\\nThe Global Baking and Snacking segment aggregates the following operating segments: Pepperidge Farm cookies, crackers, bakery and frozen products in U.S.\\xa0retail; Arnott\\'s biscuits in Australia and Asia Pacific; and as of August 8, 2013, Kelsen cookies globally.\\n\\n45 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe International Simple Meals and Beverages segment aggregates the following operating segments: the retail business in Canada and the simple meals and beverages business in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and China. \\n\\nThe U.S.\\xa0Beverages segment represents the U.S. retail beverages business, including the following products: V8 juices and beverages; and Campbell\\'s tomato juice.\\n\\nBolthouse and Foodservice comprises the Bolthouse Farms carrot products operating segment (Farms), including fresh carrots, juice concentrate and fiber; the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated beverages and refrigerated salad dressings operating segment (CPG); the North America Foodservice operating segment; and as of June 29, 2015, the Garden Fresh Gourmet operating segment. The North America Foodservice operating segment represents the distribution of products such as soup, specialty entrees, beverage products, other prepared foods and Pepperidge Farm products through various food service channels in the U.S. and Canada. None of these operating segments meets the criteria for aggregation nor the thresholds for separate disclosure. Bolthouse Farms was acquired on August 6, 2012.\\n\\nWe evaluate segment performance before interest, taxes and costs associated with restructuring activities. Unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedging activities are excluded from segment operating earnings and are recorded in Corporate expenses as these open positions represent hedges of future purchases. Upon closing of the contracts, the realized gain or loss is transferred to segment operating earnings, which allows the segments to reflect the economic effects of the hedge without exposure to quarterly volatility of unrealized gains and losses. Certain manufacturing, warehousing and distribution activities of the segments are integrated in order to maximize efficiency and productivity. As a result, asset information by segment is not discretely maintained for internal reporting or used in evaluating performance. Therefore, only geographic segment asset information is included in the disclosure.\\n\\nOn January 29, 2015, we announced plans to implement a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. Under the new design, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are organized in the following three new divisions: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh. We are managing our operations under the new structure in 2016, and will modify segment reporting as appropriate.\\n\\nOur largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% in 2015, and 19% of consolidated net sales in 2014 and 2013.

Under the new design, which we fully implemented at the beginning of 2016, our businesses are organized in the following divisions: Americas Simple Meals and Beverages, Global Biscuits and Snacks, and Campbell Fresh. \\n\\nIn support of the new enterprise design, we designed and implemented a new Integrated Global Services (IGS) organization to deliver shared services across the company. IGS, which became effective at the beginning of 2016, is expected to reduce costs while increasing our efficiency and effectiveness. We are also pursuing other initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organizational structure and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. \\n\\nAs part of these initiatives, we commenced a voluntary employee separation program available to certain U.S.-based salaried employees nearing retirement who met age, length-of-service and business unit/function criteria. A total of 471 employees elected the program. The electing employees remained with us through July 31, 2015, with some remaining beyond July 31. We also implemented an initiative to reduce overhead across the organization by eliminating approximately 230 positions. In 2015, we recorded a restructuring charge of $102 related to these initiatives.\\n\\nFinally, we incurred charges of $22 recorded in Administrative expenses related to the implementation of the new organizational structure and cost reduction initiatives. \\n\\nThe aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and implementation and other costs recorded in 2015 was $78, or $.25 per share.

The closure resulted in the elimination of approximately 700 full-time positions and was completed in phases. Most of the positions were eliminated in 2013, and operations ceased in August 2013. We shifted the majority of Sacramento\\'s soup, sauce and beverage production to our thermal plants in Maxton, North Carolina; Napoleon, Ohio; and Paris, Texas. We also closed our South Plainfield, New Jersey, spice plant, which resulted in the elimination of 27 positions. We consolidated spice production at our Milwaukee, Wisconsin, plant in 2013.    \\n\\n•\\n\\nIn Mexico, we entered into commercial arrangements with third-party providers to expand access to manufacturing and distribution capabilities. The third-party providers produce and distribute our beverages, soups, broths and sauces throughout the Mexican market. As a result of these agreements, we closed our plant in Villagran, Mexico, and eliminated approximately 260 positions in the first quarter of 2014.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nWe implemented an initiative to improve our Pepperidge Farm bakery supply chain cost structure by closing our plant in Aiken, South Carolina. The plant was closed in May 2014. We shifted the majority of Aiken\\'s bread production to our bakery plant in Lakeland, Florida. Approximately 110 positions were eliminated as a result of the plant closure.  \\n\\n•\\n\\nWe streamlined our salaried workforce in U.S. Simple Meals, North America Foodservice and U.S. Beverages by approximately 70 positions. This action was substantially completed in August 2013.   \\n\\n50 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nIn 2014, we recorded a restructuring charge of $1 related to the 2013 initiatives. In addition, we recorded approximately $3 of costs related to the 2013 initiatives in Cost of products sold, representing other exit costs. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs recorded in 2014 was $3, or $.01 per share. In 2013, we recorded a restructuring charge of $51. In addition, we recorded approximately $91 of costs related to these initiatives in 2013 in Cost of products sold, representing accelerated depreciation and other exit costs. The aggregate after-tax impact of restructuring charges and related costs recorded in 2013 was $90, or $.28 per share.

The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on years of service and compensation levels. In 1999, we implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continues to accrue through the year 2015 for active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Benefits become vested upon the completion of three years of service. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees and insurance companies or are paid directly by us from general funds. Effective as of January 1, 2011, our U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans. \\n\\nPostretirement Benefits -- We provide postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance, to substantially all retired U.S. employees and their dependents. We established retiree medical account benefits for eligible U.S. retirees. The accounts were intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis. Effective as of January 1, 2011, the retirement medical program was amended to eliminate the retiree medical account benefit for employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements. To preserve the benefit for employees close to retirement age, the retiree medical account will be available to employees who were at least age 50 with at least 10 years of service as of December 31, 2010, and who satisfy the other eligibility requirements for the retiree medical program. \\n\\nWe use the fiscal year end as the measurement date for the benefit plans. \\n\\nComponents of benefit expense were as follows:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPension  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2013  \\n\\nService cost\\n\\n$\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n57\\n\\nInterest cost\\n\\n105\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n115\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n108\\n\\nExpected return on plan assets\\n\\n(173\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(176\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(177\\n\\n)  \\n\\nAmortization of prior service credit\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)  \\n\\nRecognized net actuarial loss\\n\\n84\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n108\\n\\nCurtailment loss\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3\\n\\nSettlement charges\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nNet periodic benefit expense\\n\\n$\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n78\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n98\\n\\nThe curtailment loss of $1 in 2015 was related to a voluntary employee separation program and was included in Restructuring charges.

In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class, and a premium for active management. \\n\\nThe discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement expense was 4.00% in 2015, 4.50% in 2014 and 3.75% in 2013. \\n\\nAssumed health care cost trend rates at the end of the year:   \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014  \\n\\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7.75%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n8.25%  \\n\\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate trend rate)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.50%\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4.50%  \\n\\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2022\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2022  \\n\\n54 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nA one-percentage-point change in assumed health care costs would have the following effects on 2015 reported amounts:   \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nIncrease\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDecrease  \\n\\nEffect on service and interest cost\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)  \\n\\nEffect on the 2015 accumulated benefit obligation\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n(22\\n\\n)  \\n\\nPension Plan Assets \\n\\nThe fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations. \\n\\nThe primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to plan obligations. This includes investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations. \\n\\nThe portfolio includes investments in the following asset classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives. Fixed income will provide a moderate expected return and partially hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the plans\\' obligations. Equities are used for their high expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide diversification. \\n\\nAsset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to the established asset class targets. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets. The investment policy permits variances from the targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when the underlying asset class allocations move outside these parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back to the policy target weight. \\n\\nOur

\\n\\nShort-term investments -- Investments include cash and cash equivalents, and various short-term debt instruments and short-term investment funds. Institutional short-term investment vehicles valued daily are classified as Level 1 at cost which approximates market value. Other investments valued based upon a quoted net asset value are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table.\\n\\nEquities -- Common stocks and preferred stocks are classified as Level 1 and are valued using quoted market prices in active markets. \\n\\nCorporate bonds -- These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates. \\n\\nGovernment and agency bonds -- These investments are generally valued based on bid quotations and recent trade data for identical or similar obligations. \\n\\n56 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nMunicipal bonds -- These investments are valued based on quoted market prices, yield curves and pricing models using current market rates. \\n\\nMortgage and asset backed securities -- Fair value is based on prices obtained from third party pricing sources. The prices from third party pricing sources may be based on bid quotes from dealers and recent trade data. Mortgage backed securities are traded in the over-the-counter market. \\n\\nReal estate -- Real estate investments consist of real estate investment trusts, property funds and limited partnerships. Real estate investment trusts are classified as Level 1 and are valued based on quoted market prices. Property funds are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3 depending upon whether liquidity is limited or there are few observable market participant transactions. Fair value is based on third party appraisals. Limited partnerships are valued based upon valuations provided by the general partners of the funds. The values of limited partnerships are based upon an assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating valuations that consider the evaluation of financing and sales transactions with third parties, expected cash flows, and market-based information, including comparable transactions and performance multiples among other factors. The investments are classified as Level 3 since the valuation is determined using unobservable inputs. Real estate investments valued at net asset value are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table.\\n\\nHedge funds -- Hedge fund investments include hedge funds valued based upon a net asset value derived from the fair value of underlying securities. Hedge fund investments that are subject to liquidity restrictions or that are based on unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3. Hedge fund investments may include long and short positions in equity and fixed income securities, derivative instruments such as futures and options, commodities and other types of securities. Hedge fund investments valued at net asset value are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table.\\n\\nDerivatives -- Derivative financial instruments include forward currency contracts, futures contracts, options contracts, interest rate swaps and credit default swaps. Derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2 and are valued based on observable market transactions or prices.\\n\\nCommingled funds -- Investments in commingled funds are not traded in active markets. Blended commingled funds are invested in both equities and fixed income securities. Commingled funds are valued based on the net asset values of such funds. and are included as a reconciling item to the fair value table.\\n\\nOther items to reconcile to fair value of plan assets included amounts due for securities sold, amounts payable for securities purchased, and other payables. \\n\\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value of Level 3 investments for the years ended August\\xa02, 2015, and August\\xa03, 2014:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nReal Estate\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nHedge Funds\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTotal  \\n\\nFair value at August 3, 2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n33\\n\\nActual return on plan assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3\\n\\nPurchases\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n9\\n\\nSales\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nSettlements\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nTransfers out of Level 3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nFair value at August 2, 2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n45\\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nReal Estate\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nHedge Funds\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTotal  \\n\\nFair value at July 28, 2013\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n25\\n\\nActual return on plan assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\nPurchases\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7\\n\\nSales\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nSettlements\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nTransfers out of Level 3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\nFair value at August 3, 2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n33\\n\\n57 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe following table presents additional information about the pension plan assets valued using NAV as a practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy table.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFair Value\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nUnfunded Commitments\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFair Value\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nUnfunded Commitments\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRedemption Frequency\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRedemption Notice Period Range  \\n\\nShort-term investments\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDaily\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 Day  \\n\\nCommingled funds:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nEquities\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n375\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n393\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDaily,\\n\\nMonthly\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\nto\\n\\n120 Days  \\n\\nFixed income\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDaily\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1 Day  \\n\\nBlended\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n95\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPrimarily Daily\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\nto\\n\\n20 Days  \\n\\nReal estate funds\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n117\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPrimarily Quarterly\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\nto\\n\\n90 Days  \\n\\nHedge funds\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n175\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n151\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMonthly,\\n\\nQuarterly\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n5\\n\\nto\\n\\n95 Days  \\n\\nTotal\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n805\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n821\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nNo contributions are expected to be made to U.S. pension plans in 2016.

Effective January 1, 2011, we provide a matching contribution of 100% of employee contributions up to 4% of compensation for employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. Employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2011 who will not be eligible to participate in the defined benefit plans and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements receive a contribution equal to 3% of compensation regardless of their participation in the Savings Plan. Prior to January 1, 2011, we provided a matching contribution of 60% (50% at certain locations) of the employee contributions up to 5% of compensation after one year of continued service.

Of these carryforwards, $127 expire between 2016 and 2035, and $46 may be carried forward indefinitely. The current statutory tax rates in these countries range from 16% to 35%. At August\\xa02, 2015, deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established to offset $142 of these tax loss carryforwards. Additionally, at August\\xa02, 2015, our non-U.S. subsidiaries had capital loss carryforwards of approximately $298, which were fully offset by valuation allowances.\\n\\nThe net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2015 was a decrease of $29. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of currency and the expiration of tax losses, partially offset by the recognition of additional valuation allowances on other foreign loss carryforwards. The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2014 was an increase of $3. The increase was primarily due to the impact of currency and the recognition of additional valuation allowances on foreign loss carryforwards.\\n\\nAs of August\\xa02, 2015, other deferred tax assets included $2 of state tax credit carryforwards related to various states that expire between 2018 and 2024. As of August\\xa03, 2014, other deferred tax assets included $9 of state tax credit carryforwards related to various states that expire between 2018 and 2024. No valuation allowances have been established related to these deferred tax assets.\\n\\nAs of August\\xa02, 2015, U.S. income taxes have not been provided on approximately $770 of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are deemed to be permanently reinvested. It is not practical to estimate the tax liability that might be incurred if such earnings were remitted to the U.S. \\n\\nA reconciliation of the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits follows:   \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2013  \\n\\nBalance at beginning of year\\n\\n$\\n\\n71\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n48\\n\\nIncreases related to prior-year tax positions\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n28\\n\\nDecreases related to prior-year tax positions\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(1\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(7\\n\\n)  \\n\\nIncreases related to current-year tax positions\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n9\\n\\nSettlements\\n\\n(27\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(15\\n\\n)  \\n\\nLapse of statute\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(2\\n\\n)  \\n\\nBalance at end of year\\n\\n$\\n\\n58\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n71\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n61\\n\\nThe decrease in 2015 is primarily due to the settlement of an intercompany pricing agreement between the U.S. and Canada  for the years from 2006 though 2014. \\n\\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the annual effective tax rate was $39 as of August\\xa02, 2015, and $23 as of August\\xa03, 2014, and July\\xa028, 2013. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination activities, statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. We are unable to estimate what this change may be within the next 12 months, but do not believe that it will be material to the financial statements. Approximately $5 and  $2 of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, were reported as accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August\\xa02, 2015, and August\\xa03, 2014, respectively. \\n\\nOur accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any expense or benefit as a component of our income tax provision. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was not material in 2015, 2014 and 2013. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $3 as of August\\xa02, 2015, and August\\xa03, 2014. \\n\\nWe do business internationally and, as a result, file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as the U.S., Australia, Canada and Denmark. The 2015 tax year is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, several state income tax examinations are in progress for the years 2003 to 2014.\\n\\nWith limited exceptions, we have been audited for income tax purposes in Australia and Denmark through 2010, and in Canada through 2009.\\n\\n60 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\n13.\\n\\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt  \\n\\nShort-term borrowings consist of the following:   \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2014  \\n\\nCommercial paper\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,532\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,406\\n\\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n300\\n\\nVariable-rate bank borrowings\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n47\\n\\nFixed-rate bank borrowings\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n17\\n\\nCapital leases\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,543\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1,771\\n\\nAs of August\\xa02, 2015, the weighted-average interest rate of commercial paper, which consisted of U.S. borrowings, was 0.58%.

As of August\\xa02, 2015, we issued $50 of standby letters of credit. We have a committed revolving credit facility totaling $2,200 that matures in December 2018. This facility remained unused at August\\xa02, 2015, except for $3\\xa0of standby letters of credit that we issued under it.\\xa0This revolving credit facility supports our commercial paper programs and other general corporate purposes.

Interest on the notes is due semi-annually on March 19 and September 19, commencing on September 19, 2015. The notes may be redeemed in whole, or in part, at our option at any time at the applicable redemption price. In certain circumstances, we may be required to repurchase some or all of the notes upon a change in control of our company and a downgrade of the notes below investment grade.\\n\\nPrincipal amounts of long-term debt mature as follows: $1 in 2016; $401 in 2017; $1 in 2018; $301 in 2019; $0 in 2020; and a total of $1,857 in periods beyond 2020. \\n\\n14.\\n\\nFinancial Instruments  \\n\\nThe principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to equity price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. In order to manage these exposures, we follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps, options, forwards and commodity futures. We enter into these derivative contracts for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not \\n\\n61 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nenter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. Our derivative programs include instruments that qualify and others that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\\n\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\n\\nWe are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, we enter into contracts only with carefully selected, leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk.\\xa0We do not have credit-risk-related contingent features in our derivative instruments as of August\\xa02, 2015. During 2015, our largest customer accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net sales. We closely monitor credit risk associated with counterparties and customers.\\n\\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\\n\\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our international operations, including non-functional currency intercompany debt and net investments in subsidiaries. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries. Principal currencies hedged include the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and U.S. dollar. We utilize foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts, as well as cross-currency swaps, to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge portions of our forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to 18 months. To hedge currency exposures related to intercompany debt, we enter into foreign exchange forward purchase and sale contracts, as well as cross-currency swap contracts, for periods consistent with the underlying debt. As of August\\xa02, 2015, cross-currency swap contracts mature between 12 and 24 months. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $53 at August\\xa02, 2015, and $58 at August\\xa03, 2014. The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings on the same line item and the same period in which the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward and cross-currency swap contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $480 and $561 at August\\xa02, 2015, and August\\xa03, 2014, respectively.\\n\\nInterest Rate Risk\\n\\nWe manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and by utilizing interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. Receive fixed rate/pay variable rate interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair-value hedges. We manage our exposure to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the anticipated debt issuances. These pay fixed rate/receive variable rate forward starting interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash-flow hedges. The effective portion of the changes in fair value on these instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings over the life of the debt. The notional amount of outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps totaled $300 at August\\xa02, 2015, which relates to an anticipated debt issuance in 2018. The notional amount of outstanding forward starting interest rate swaps totaled $250 at August\\xa03, 2014. We settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $250 during 2015 at a loss of $4. The effective portion of the loss was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized as additional interest expense over the 10-year life of debt issued in March 2015. \\n\\nCommodity Price Risk\\n\\nWe principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of diesel fuel, wheat, soybean oil, aluminum, natural gas, cocoa, butter, corn and cheese, which impact the cost of raw materials. Commodity futures, options, and swap contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to 18 months. There were no commodity contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges as of August\\xa02, 2015, or August\\xa03, 2014. The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was $95 at August\\xa02, 2015, and $146 at August\\xa03, 2014.\\n\\nEquity Price Risk\\n\\nWe enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to certain deferred compensation obligations linked to the total return of our capital stock, the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index, and the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index. Under these contracts, we pay variable interest rates and receive from the counterparty either the total return on our capital stock; the total return of the Standard & Poor\\'s 500 Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Institutional Index; or the total return of the iShares MSCI EAFE Index, which is expected to approximate the total return of the Vanguard Total International Stock Index.

When available, we use unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, we base fair value upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates.

as part of our annual review of intangible assets, we recognized an impairment charge of $6 on minor trademarks used in the Global Baking and Snacking segment. See also Note 6. The carrying value was $9 as of August 2, 2015. Fair value was determined based on unobservable Level 3 inputs. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analysis that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average cost of capital, and assumed royalty rates.\\n\\nIn the second quarter of 2014, we recognized an impairment charge of  $11 on plant assets associated with the initiative to restructure manufacturing and streamline operations for our soup and broth business in China. See also Note 8. The carrying value was reduced to estimated fair value based on expected proceeds. The carrying value was not material.\\n\\nOn October 28, 2013, we completed the sale of our European simple meals business. The assets and liabilities of the European business have been reflected in assets and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of July 28, 2013. We reflected the results of the business as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The business was historically included in the International Simple Meals and Beverages segment. \\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $360 was recorded on goodwill for the simple meals business in Europe to reduce the carrying value to the implied fair value of $110. The impairment was attributable to a combination of factors, including the existence of a firm offer to purchase the business; a revised future outlook for the business, with reduced expectations for future sales and discounted cash flows, given the economic uncertainty in the region; future investments required to maintain performance; and management\\'s assumptions on the weighted average cost of capital. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses, which are unobservable Level 3 inputs, and taking into account the firm offer. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, and future economic and market conditions. \\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2013, as part of our annual review of intangible assets, an impairment charge of $36 was recognized on trademarks used in the European simple meals business. See also Note 6. Fair value was determined based on unobservable Level 3 inputs. Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flow analysis that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and assumed royalty rates. \\n\\nThe following table presents our fair value measurements of intangible assets that were recognized in the year ended  July\\xa028, \\n\\n2013:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n2013  \\n\\nIntangible assets\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nImpairment\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFair Value  \\n\\nBla Band\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n19\\n\\nHeisse Tasse\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n6\\n\\nIsomitta\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n4\\n\\nRoyco\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n53\\n\\nIn 2013, we also recognized $99 of accelerated depreciation/asset impairment on plant assets associated with the 2013 restructuring initiatives described in Note 8.

The carrying value was $29 at July\\xa028, 2013.\\n\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\n\\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings, excluding the current portion of long-term debt, approximate fair value. \\n\\nCash equivalents of $39 at August\\xa02, 2015, and $46 at August\\xa03, 2014, represent fair value as these highly liquid investments have an original maturity of three months or less. Fair value of cash equivalents is based on Level 2 inputs. \\n\\nThe fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt in Short-term borrowings, was $2,623 at August\\xa02, 2015, and $2,647 at August\\xa03, 2014.

This program has no expiration date. In addition to this publicly announced program, we also purchase shares to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation plans. \\n\\nIn 2015, we repurchased 5 million shares at a cost of $244. Of this amount, $200 was used to repurchase shares pursuant to our June 2011 publicly announced share repurchase program. Approximately $550 remained available under this program as of August\\xa02, 2015. In 2014, we repurchased 2 million shares at a cost of $76 and in 2013, we repurchased 4 million shares at a cost of $153 to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation plans.\\n\\n17.\\n\\nStock-based Compensation  \\n\\nIn 2003, shareholders approved the 2003 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of an aggregate of 31.2 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. In 2005, shareholders approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of an additional 6 million shares to satisfy the same types of awards. In 2008, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 10.5 million and in 2010, shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 17.5 million. \\n\\nAwards under Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units, time-lapse restricted stock/units and special performance restricted stock/units. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a three-year period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon our ranking in the performance peer group, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 225% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units will be earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals. During the three-year vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award of either 0% or 100% of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units are earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a two- or three-year period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 200% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the three-year period. In addition, we may issue special grants of restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October. \\n\\nAnnual stock option grants were not part of the long-term incentive compensation program for 2015, 2014, or 2013. However, stock options may still be granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans.The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed ten years from the date of grant. Options granted under these plans vest cumulatively over a three-year period at a rate of 30%, 60% and 100%, respectively. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant.\\n\\nIn 2015, we issued time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units, TSR performance restricted stock units and special performance restricted stock units. We did not issue strategic performance restricted stock units in 2015. \\n\\nTotal pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in Earnings from continuing operations was $57 for 2015, $56 for 2014 and $109 for 2013. The pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations was $1 for 2014 and $4 for 2013. Tax-related benefits of $21 were recognized for 2015 and 2014, and $42 were recognized for 2013.  \\n\\n67 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity as of August\\xa02, 2015:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nOptions\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWeighted-\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nExercise\\n\\nPrice\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWeighted-\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nRemaining\\n\\nContractual\\n\\nLife\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAggregate\\n\\nIntrinsic\\n\\nValue  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(Options\\xa0in\\n\\nthousands)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(In years)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nOutstanding at August 3, 2014\\n\\n408\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n28.33\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nGranted\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nExercised\\n\\n(331\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n27.98\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nTerminated\\n\\n(3\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n26.36\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nOutstanding at August 2, 2015\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n29.91\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1\\n\\nExercisable at August 2, 2015\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n29.91\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n0.4\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n1\\n\\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2015, 2014 and 2013, was $5, $12 and $36, respectively.

We expense time-lapse restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which we expense on an accelerated basis. We expense EPS performance restricted stock units on a graded-vesting basis, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants, which we expense on an accelerated basis. There were 246 thousand EPS performance target grants outstanding at August\\xa02, 2015, with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $40.69. We expense strategic performance restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the service period. There were 360 thousand strategic performance target grants outstanding at August\\xa02, 2015, with a grant-date fair value of $41.21. The actual number of EPS performance restricted stock units and strategic performance restricted stock units that vest will depend on actual performance achieved. We estimate expense based on the number of awards expected to vest.\\n\\nIn 2015, we issued special performance restricted stock units for which vesting is contingent upon meeting various financial goals and performance milestones to support innovation and growth initiatives. These awards vest over a period of 2 years and are included in the table above. The actual number of special performance awards issued at the vesting date could range from 0% to 150%. There were 184 thousand special performance restricted stock units outstanding at August\\xa02, 2015, with a grant-date fair value of $42.22.  \\n\\nAs of August\\xa02, 2015, total remaining unearned compensation related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock units, EPS performance restricted stock units, strategic performance restricted stock units and special performance restricted stock units was $32, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.6 years. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $56, $106 and $57, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted during 2014 and 2013 was $39.97 and $35.44, respectively.\\n\\n68 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe following table summarizes TSR performance restricted stock units as of August\\xa02, 2015:  \\n\\n---  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nUnits\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWeighted-\\n\\nAverage\\n\\nGrant-Date\\n\\nFair Value  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n(Restricted\\xa0stock\\n\\nunits\\xa0in\\xa0thousands)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nNonvested at August 3, 2014\\n\\n861\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n38.15\\n\\nGranted\\n\\n874\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n43.39\\n\\nVested\\n\\n--\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n--\\n\\nForfeited\\n\\n(156\\n\\n)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n41.23\\n\\nNonvested at August 2, 2015\\n\\n1,579\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n$\\n\\n40.75\\n\\nWe estimated the fair value of TSR performance restricted stock units at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.

As of August\\xa02, 2015, total remaining unearned compensation related to TSR performance restricted stock units was $26, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 1.9 years. In the first quarter of 2014, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units earned 0% of the initial grants based upon our TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 26, 2013. There were no TSR performance restricted stock units granted during 2012. The grant-date fair value of the TSR performance restricted stock units granted during 2014 and 2013 was $36.26 and $39.76, respectively. In the first quarter of 2016, recipients of TSR performance restricted stock units will receive a 100% payout based upon our TSR ranking in a performance peer group during a three-year period ended July 31, 2015. \\n\\nThe excess tax benefits on the exercise of stock options and vested restricted stock presented as cash flows from financing activities were $6 in 2015, $13 in 2014 and $12 in 2013. Cash received from the exercise of stock options was $9, $18 and $83 for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are reflected in cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\n\\n18.\\n\\nCommitments and Contingencies  \\n\\nWe are a party to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. \\n\\nWe assess the probability of loss for all legal proceedings and claims and have recognized liabilities for such contingencies. Although the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in our opinion, the final outcome of legal proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. \\n\\nWe have certain operating lease commitments, primarily related to warehouse and office facilities, and certain equipment. Rent expense under operating lease commitments was $48 in 2015, $50 in 2014 and $54 in 2013. These amounts included $2 in 2014 and $8 in 2013 related to discontinued operations. Future minimum annual rental payments under these operating leases as of August 3, 2014, are as follows:   \\n\\n---  \\n\\n2016\\n\\n2017\\n\\n2018\\n\\n2019\\n\\n2020\\n\\nThereafter  \\n\\n$38\\n\\n$26\\n\\n$22\\n\\n$17\\n\\n$15\\n\\n$21  \\n\\nWe guarantee approximately 2,000 bank loans made to Pepperidge Farm independent sales distributors by third‑party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $192. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not believe it is probable that we will be required to make guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized as of August 2, 2015, and August 3, 2014, were not material. \\n\\nWe have provided certain standard indemnifications in connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions. Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates.

The financial information appearing throughout this Report is consistent with the financial statements. Management is responsible for the information and representations in such financial statements, including the estimates and judgments required for their preparation. The financial statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of Directors who are not officers or employees of the company, meets regularly with the company\\'s worldwide internal auditing department, other management personnel, and the independent registered public accounting firm. The independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditing department have had, and continue to have, direct access to the Audit Committee without the presence of other management personnel, and have been directed to discuss the results of their audit work and any matters they believe should be brought to the Committee\\'s attention. The internal auditing department and the independent registered public accounting firm report directly to the Audit Committee.\\xa0\\n\\nManagement\\'s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\n\\nThe company\\'s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.\\xa0\\n\\nThe company\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\xa0\\n\\n•\\n\\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;  \\n\\n•\\n\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the company; and  \\n\\n•\\n\\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\xa0\\n\\nThe company\\'s management assessed the effectiveness of the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of August\\xa02, 2015.\\xa0In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of\\xa0Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control\\xa0-- Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August\\xa02, 2015. \\n\\n75 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThe effectiveness of the company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of August\\xa02, 2015 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears herein.\\n\\n---  \\n\\n/s/ Denise M.

In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August\\xa02, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company\\'s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management\\'s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \\n\\nA company\\'s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\\'s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\n\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n\\n---  \\n\\n/s/\\xa0PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\nSeptember\\xa029, 2015\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0  \\n\\n77 \\n\\n* * *\\n\\nItem 9.

      " In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive industry We operate in the highly competitive food industry and experience international competition in all of our principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of our primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share. Our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into faster-growing spaces Our strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into faster-growing spaces. Our core businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional mass and grocery channels. Factors that may impact our success include: •our ability to identify and capitalize on faster-growing spaces; • our ability to identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to new or improved products or packaging or to our existing products; •our ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans; •our ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs, including digital programs; •our ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers; and •changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete. If we are not successful in addressing theses factors, our strategy may not be successful and/or our business or financial results may be negatively impacted. We may not realize anticipated benefits from our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives We recently implemented a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. We are also pursuing related initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organization and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. The success of these initiatives presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require extensive negotiations with third parties, such as suppliers and other business partners. As a result, we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiatives. Other events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits, or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. In addition, the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected. Finally, the complexity of the initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. From time-to-time, we may also implement other supply chain, information technology or related initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these additional initiatives, which are often complex. Any failure to implement our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results. Our results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include: •the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; •potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses; 6 * * * •potential assumption of unknown liabilities; •the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; •potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and •the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from us effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Our business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed. Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business Our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, crop disease and/or crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results. Our non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to our business In 2015, approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. Our business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following: •unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions; • the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; • the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases; • the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies; • political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, armed hostilities or terrorist acts; • the possible nationalization of operations; • the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and • restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potentially negative tax consequences. In addition, we hold assets and incur liabilities, generate revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions Customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact us. Increased regulation or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business or financial results The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as 7 * * * the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed labeling requirements), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or could adversely affect our business or financial results. Our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materials The raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including crop size, cattle cycles, disease, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change). To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations Our business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could: • unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water; • disrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products; • disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or • unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products. In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace We intend to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers Our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in pursuing our strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers or more favorable terms. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. In 2015, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. 8 * * * If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim. We may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems Our information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of our functions, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. If we are unable to prevent material failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations. Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands We have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth As of August 2, 2015, we had goodwill of $2.3 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $960 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth. We may be adversely impacted by legal proceedings or claims We are party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such proceedings or claims, or that our assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such proceedings or claims. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by allegations made in legal proceeding or claims (even if untrue). In the event we are unable to successfully defend ourselves against these proceedings or claims, or if our assessment of the materiality of these proceedings or claims proves inaccurate, our business or financial results may be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by increased liabilities and costs related to our defined benefit pension plans We sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for employees in the U.S. and various non-U.S. locations. The major defined benefit pension plans are funded with trust assets invested in a globally diversified portfolio of securities and other investments. Changes in regulatory requirements or the market value of plan assets, investment returns, interest rates and mortality rates may affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future 9 * * * funding requirements of the plans and the funded status as recorded on the balance sheet. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \n"

       "\" In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations and financial condition. We operate in a highly competitive industry We operate in the highly competitive food industry and experience international competition in all of our principal products. The principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, quality, price, advertising, promotion, convenience and service. A number of our primary competitors have substantial financial, marketing and other resources. A strong competitive response from one or more of these competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards private label offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, and/or losing market share. Our results are dependent on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying into faster-growing spaces Our strategy is focused on strengthening our core businesses while diversifying our portfolio into faster-growing spaces. Our core businesses are concentrated in slower-growing center-store categories in traditional mass and grocery channels. Factors that may impact our success include: •our ability to identify and capitalize on faster-growing spaces; • our ability to identify and capitalize on customer or consumer trends, including those related to new or improved products or packaging or to our existing products; •our ability to design and implement effective retail execution plans; •our ability to design and implement effective advertising and marketing programs, including digital programs; •our ability to secure or maintain sufficient shelf space at retailers; and •changes in underlying growth rates of the categories in which we compete. If we are not successful in addressing theses factors, our strategy may not be successful and/or our business or financial results may be negatively impacted. We may not realize anticipated benefits from our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives We recently implemented a new enterprise design focused mainly on product categories. We are also pursuing related initiatives to reduce costs and increase effectiveness, such as streamlining our organization and adopting zero-based budgeting over time. The success of these initiatives presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require extensive negotiations with third parties, such as suppliers and other business partners. As a result, we may not realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits from the initiatives. Other events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays or unexpected costs, may also adversely impact our ability to realize all or part of the anticipated cost savings or other benefits, or cause us not to realize the anticipated cost savings or other benefits on the expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated cost savings, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. In addition, the initiatives may not advance our strategy as expected. Finally, the complexity of the initiatives will require a substantial amount of management and operational resources. Our management team must successfully execute the administrative and operational changes necessary to achieve the anticipated benefits of the initiatives. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization's attention from other business issues, have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, and impact employee morale. From time-to-time, we may also implement other supply chain, information technology or related initiatives. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these additional initiatives, which are often complex. Any failure to implement our cost reduction, organizational design or other initiatives in accordance with our plans could adversely affect our business or financial results. Our results may be adversely affected by the failure to execute acquisitions and divestitures successfully Our ability to meet our objectives with respect to the acquisition of new businesses or the divestiture of existing businesses may depend in part on our ability to identify suitable buyers and sellers, negotiate favorable financial terms and other contractual terms, and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Potential risks of acquisitions also include: •the inability to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our existing operations; •diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; •potential loss of key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses; 6 * * * •potential assumption of unknown liabilities; •the inability to implement promptly an effective control environment; •potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved or market conditions decline; and •the risks inherent in entering markets or lines of business with which we have limited or no prior experience. Acquisitions outside the U.S. may present unique challenges and increase our exposure to risks associated with foreign operations, including foreign currency risks and risks associated with local regulatory regimes. For divestitures, potential risks may also include the inability to separate divested businesses or business units from us effectively and efficiently and to reduce or eliminate associated overhead costs. Our business or financial results may be negatively affected if acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed. Disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our business Our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products may be impaired by damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to the capabilities of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, due to factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, pandemics, strikes or other events. Production of the agricultural commodities used in our business may also be adversely affected by drought, water scarcity, temperature extremes, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, crop disease and/or crop pests. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, may adversely affect our business or financial results, particularly in circumstances where a product is sourced from a single supplier or location. Disputes with significant suppliers or contract manufacturers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, may also adversely affect our ability to manufacture and/or sell our products, as well as our business or financial results. Our non-U.S. operations pose additional risks to our business In 2015, approximately 21% of our consolidated net sales from continuing operations were generated outside of the U.S. Sales outside the U.S. are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of consolidated net sales. Our business or financial performance may be adversely affected due to the risks of doing business in markets outside of the U.S., including but not limited to the following: •unfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export and import restrictions; • the difficulty and/or costs of complying with a wide variety of laws, treaties and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; • the difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases; • the adverse impact of foreign tax treaties and policies; • political or economic instability, including the possibility of civil unrest, armed hostilities or terrorist acts; • the possible nationalization of operations; • the difficulty of enforcing remedies and protecting intellectual property in various jurisdictions; and • restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from countries outside of the U.S., including potentially negative tax consequences. In addition, we hold assets and incur liabilities, generate revenue, and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S.\\xa0dollar, primarily the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S.\\xa0dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S.\\xa0dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S.\\xa0dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. We face risks related to recession, financial and credit market disruptions and other economic conditions Customer and consumer demand for our products may be impacted by weak economic conditions, recession, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers and creditors. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates in the U.S. or other nations, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could impact us. Increased regulation or regulatory-based claims could adversely affect our business or financial results The manufacture and marketing of food products is extensively regulated. The primary areas of regulation include the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, marketing, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of our food products, as well as 7 * * * the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. In the U.S., we are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. We are also regulated by similar agencies outside the U.S. Changes in regulatory requirements (such as proposed labeling requirements), or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance cost, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, the marketing of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state and foreign laws or regulations. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or could adversely affect our business or financial results. Our results may be adversely impacted by increases in the price of raw and packaging materials The raw and packaging materials used in our business include tomato paste, grains, beef, poultry, vegetables, steel, glass, paper and resin. Many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including crop size, cattle cycles, disease, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, government-sponsored agricultural programs, import and export requirements, drought and other weather conditions (including the potential effects of climate change). To the extent any of these factors result in an increase in raw and packaging material prices, we may not be able to offset such increases through productivity or price increases or through our commodity hedging activity. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our business or operations Our business or financial results could be adversely affected by changing global temperatures or weather patterns or by extreme or unusual weather conditions. Adverse changes in the global climate or extreme or unusual weather conditions could: • unfavorably impact the cost or availability of raw or packaging materials, especially if such events have a negative impact on agricultural productivity or on the supply of water; • disrupt our ability, or the ability of our suppliers or contract manufacturers, to manufacture or distribute our products; • disrupt the retail operations of our customers; or • unfavorably impact the demand for, or the consumer's ability to purchase, our products. In addition, there is growing concern that the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere may be impacting global temperatures and weather patterns and contributing to extreme or unusual weather conditions. This growing concern may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. Adoption of such additional regulation may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results. Price increases may not be sufficient to cover increased costs, or may result in declines in sales volume due to pricing elasticity in the marketplace We intend to pass along to customers some or all cost increases in raw and packaging materials and other inputs through increases in the selling prices of, or decreases in the packaging sizes of, some of our products. Higher product prices or smaller packaging sizes may result in reductions in sales volume. To the extent the price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset increased raw and packaging materials and other input costs, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business results and financial condition may be adversely affected. We may be adversely impacted by a changing customer landscape and the increased significance of some of our customers Our businesses are largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade. In recent years, alternative retail grocery channels, such as dollar stores, drug stores, club stores and Internet-based retailers, have increased their market share. This trend towards alternative channels is expected to continue in the future. If we are not successful in pursuing our strategy to expand sales in alternative retail grocery channels, our business or financial results may be adversely impacted. In addition, consolidations in the traditional retail grocery trade have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who may seek lower prices, increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers or more favorable terms. These customers may use more of their shelf space for their private label products. If we are unable to use our scale, marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership positions to respond to these customer dynamics, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. In 2015, our five largest customers accounted for approximately 38% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounting for approximately 20% of our consolidated net sales. Disruption of sales to any of these customers, or to any of our other large customers, for an extended period of time could adversely affect our business or financial results. 8 * * * If our food products become adulterated or are mislabeled, we might need to recall those items, and we may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured We may need to recall some of our products if they become adulterated or if they are mislabeled, and we may also be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury to consumers. A widespread product recall could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. We could also suffer losses from a significant adverse product liability judgment. A significant product recall or product liability claim could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in the safety and/or quality of our products, ingredients or packaging. Such a loss of confidence could occur even in the absence of a recall or a major product liability claim. We may be adversely impacted by inadequacies in, or security breaches of, our information technology systems Our information technology systems are critically important to our operations. We rely on our information technology systems (some of which are outsourced to third parties) to manage the data, communications and business processes for all of our functions, including our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service, accounting and administrative functions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain and protect an appropriate technology infrastructure, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to material security breaches (including the access to or acquisition of customer, consumer or other confidential data), cyber-based attacks or other material system failures. If we are unable to prevent material failures, our operations may be impacted, and we may suffer other negative consequences such as reputational damage, litigation, remediation costs and/or penalties under various data privacy laws and regulations. Our results may be negatively impacted if consumers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brands We have a number of iconic brands with significant value. Maintaining and continually enhancing the value of these brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends in large part on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products, packaging and/or ingredients (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers increases the speed and extent that information and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our results could be negatively impacted. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth As of August 2, 2015, we had goodwill of $2.3 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $960 million. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. Fair value for both goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis. If the carrying values of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to fair value. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions or assumed royalty rates. An impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could negatively affect our financial results and net worth. We may be adversely impacted by legal proceedings or claims We are party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business.

A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \""

       "'_** _In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following are important factors which could\\ncause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us._ **_A significant portion of our business depends upon non-recurring event clean-up projects over which we have no control._** A significant portion of our disposal revenue is attributable to discrete Event Business which varies widely in size, duration and unit\\npricing. For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 39% of our treatment and disposal revenue was derived from Event Business projects. The one-time nature of Event\\nBusiness necessarily creates variability in revenue and earnings. This variability is further influenced by service mix, general and industry-specific economic conditions, funding availability,\\nchanges in laws and regulations, government enforcement actions, public controversies, litigation, weather, property redevelopment plans and other factors. As a result of this variability, we can\\nexperience significant quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year volatility in revenue, gross profit, gross margin, operating income and net income. Also,\\nwhile many large project opportunities are identifiable years in advance, both large and small project opportunities also routinely arise with little prior notice. This uncertainty, which is inherent\\nto the hazardous and radioactive waste disposal industry, is factored into our budgeting and externally communicated business projections. Our projections combine historical experience with identified\\nsales pipeline opportunities and planned initiatives for new or expanded service lines. A reduction in the number and size of new clean-up projects won to replace 16 * * * Table of Contents completed\\nwork could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. **_The completion of, loss of or failure to renew one or more significant contracts could adversely affect our profitability._** We provide disposal and transportation services to customers on discrete Event Business (non-recurring project based work)\\nwhich varies widely in size, duration and unit pricing. Some of these multi-year projects can account for a significant portion of our revenue and profit. For example, in 2005 we entered\\ninto a four-year transportation and disposal contract with Honeywell to dispose of 1.3 million tons of waste at our Grand View, Idaho facility (known herein as the \"Honeywell Jersey\\nCity\" project). During this period revenue from the Honeywell Jersey City project and other smaller Honeywell projects comprised a significant portion of our total revenue. Revenue from Honeywell\\nrepresented 38% of total revenue in 2009. Subsequent to the completion of the Honeywell Jersey City project we have been successful at replacing treatment and disposal revenue from this project\\nthrough our expanded treatment and disposal capabilities, expanded permits, thermal recycling services, expanding services to waste brokers and the acquisition of Stablex. However, the replacement of\\n2011 Event Business revenue and earnings depends on multiple factors, many of which are outside of our control including, but not limited to, general and industry-specific economic conditions, capital\\nin the commercial credit markets, general level of government funding on environmental matters, real estate development and other industrial investment opportunities. Our inability to replace the\\ncontribution from 2011 Event Business projects with new business could result in a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. We\\nalso have a multi-year contract with USACE, expiring in 2013. USACE accounted for approximately 7% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011. This\\nmulti-year contract does not, however, guarantee future work or volumes. Reduced appropriations for the USACE and/or other government clean-up work, a reduction in\\nproject-specific task orders, and/or the loss of or failure to renew this or other large contracts and task orders combined with failure to replace their contribution with new projects could result in\\na material adverse affect on our business. Annual FUSRAP funding has remained generally constant ranging from $130.0 million to $140.0 million each fiscal year over the last several\\nyears but is at risk for future funding cuts. The 2012 federal fiscal budget proposed a reduction in FUSRAP funding to $109.0 million. In February 2012, President Obama released the proposed\\nfiscal 2013 budget reflecting additional cuts to the FUSRAP funding to $104.0 million. While we believe that the USACE will contract for our services for the estimated duration of the FUSRAP\\nthrough 2033 and potentially beyond, this cannot be assured. **_If we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals and contracts for construction of additional disposal space by the time our current disposal capacity is exhausted, our\\nbusiness would be adversely affected._** Construction of new disposal capacity at our operating disposal facilities beyond currently permitted capacity requires state and\\nprovincial regulatory agency approvals. Administrative processes for such approval reviews vary. The State of Texas, which regulates our Robstown facility, provides for an adjudicatory hearing process\\nadministered by a hearing officer\\nappointed by the State. While we have historically been successful in obtaining timely approvals for proposed disposal facility expansions including those involving contested proceedings, there can be\\nno assurance that we will be successful in obtaining future expansion approvals in a timely manner or at all. If we are not successful in receiving these approvals, our disposal capacity could\\neventually be exhausted, preventing us from accepting additional waste at an affected facility. This would have a material adverse effect on our business. 17 * * * Table of Contents **_If we are unable to renew our operating permits or lease agreements with regulatory bodies, our business would be adversely affected._** Our facilities operate using permits and licenses issued by various regulatory bodies at various state, provincial and federal\\ngovernment levels. In addition, three of our facilities operate on land leased from government agencies. Failure to renew our permits and licenses necessary to operate our facilities or failure to\\nrenew or maintain compliance with our site lease agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have historically been successful in obtaining timely permit applications\\napproval, maintaining compliance with our lease agreements and obtaining timely lease renewals, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the future. **_Loss of key management or sales personnel could harm our business._** We have an experienced management team and rely on the continued service of our senior managers to achieve our objectives. We also have\\na senior sales team with industry experience averaging over 15 years. Our objective is to retain our present management and sales teams and identify, hire, train, motivate and retain highly\\nskilled personnel. The loss of any key management employee or sales personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. **_If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations our business could be adversely affected._** The changing regulatory framework governing our business creates significant risks. We could be held liable if our operations cause\\ncontamination of air, groundwater or\\nsoil or expose our employees or the public to contamination. Under current law, we may be held liable for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired the assets or operations involved.\\nAlso, we may be liable if we arrange for the transportation, disposal or treatment of hazardous substances that cause environmental contamination at facilities operated by others, or if a predecessor\\nmade such arrangements and we are a successor. Liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Stringent\\nregulations of federal, state or provincial governments have a substantial impact on our business. Local government controls also apply. Many complex laws, rules, orders and\\nregulatory interpretations govern environmental protection, health, safety, noise, visual impact, odor, land use, zoning, transportation and related matters. Failure to obtain on a timely basis or\\ncomply with applicable federal, state, provincial and local governmental regulations, licenses, permits or approvals for our waste treatment and disposal facilities could prevent or restrict our\\nability to provide certain services, resulting in a potentially significant loss of revenue and earnings. Changes in environmental regulations may require us to make significant capital or other\\nexpenditures, or limit operations. Changes in laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws, regulations or permitted activities may require us to modify\\nexisting operating licenses or permits, or obtain additional approvals or limit operations. New governmental requirements that raise compliance standards or require changes in operating practices or\\ntechnology may impose significant costs and/or limit operations. Our\\nrevenues are primarily generated as a result of requirements imposed on our customers under federal, state, and provincial laws and regulations to protect public health and the\\nenvironment. If requirements to comply with laws and regulations governing management of PCB, hazardous or radioactive waste were relaxed or less vigorously enforced, demand for our services could\\nmaterially decrease and our revenues and earnings could be significantly reduced. **_Our financial results could be adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations._** We operate in both the United States and Canada, but report revenues, costs and earnings in U.S. dollars. Exchange rates between the\\nU.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar are likely to fluctuate from period to period. Because our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, we are subject to the risk of 18 * * * Table of Contents translation\\nlosses for reporting purposes. If we continue to expand our international operations, we will conduct more transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent that foreign\\nrevenue and expense transactions are not denominated in the local currency, we are also subject to the risk of\\ntransaction losses. We have not entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse\\naffect on our financial condition and results of operations. **_If we are unable to obtain at a reasonable cost or under reasonable terms and conditions the necessary levels of insurance and financial assurances required for operations,\\nour business and results of operations would be adversely affected._** We are required by law, license, permit and prudence to maintain various insurance instruments and financial assurances. We carry a\\nbroad range of insurance coverage that we believe are customary for a company of our size in our business. We obtain these coverages to mitigate risk of loss, allowing us to manage our\\nself-insured exposure from potential claims. We are self-insured for employee health-care coverage. Stop-loss insurance is carried covering liability on\\nclaims in excess of $150,000 per individual or on an aggregate basis for the monthly population. Accrued costs related to the self-insured health care coverage were $212,000 and $136,000\\nat December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We also maintain a Pollution and Remediation Legal Liability Policy pursuant to RCRA regulations subject to a $250,000 self-insured\\nretention. In addition, we are insured for consultant\\'s environmental liability subject to a $100,000 self-insured retention. We are also insured for losses or damage to third party\\nproperty or people subject to a $50,000 self-insured retention. If our insurers were unable to meet their obligations, or our own obligations for claims were more than expected, there\\ncould be a material adverse effect to our financial condition and results of operation. Through\\nDecember 31, 2011, we have met our financial assurance requirements through a combination of insurance policies, commercial surety bonds and trust funds. Our insurance\\npolicies covering closure and post-closure activities expire in December 2013 for our U.S. operating facilities. We continue to use self-funded trust accounts for our\\npost-closure obligations at our U.S. non-operating sites. We use commercial surety bonds for our Canadian operation that expire in November 2012. We currently have in place all\\nfinancial assurance instruments necessary for our operations. While we expect to continue renewing these policies and surety bonds, if we were unable to obtain adequate closure,\\npost-closure or environmental insurance, bonds or other instruments in the future, any partially or completely uninsured claim against us, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could\\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, continued access to casualty and pollution legal liability insurance with sufficient limits, at acceptable\\nterms, is important to obtaining new business. Failure to maintain adequate financial assurance could also result in regulatory action including early closure of facilities. As of December 31,\\n2011, we have $4.1 million in funded trust agreements for post closure obligations at our non-operating properties. We have provided our insurance provider a $4.0 million\\nletter of credit through our primary bank as collateral for our financial assurance insurance policies that have a limit of $44.0 million for closure and post-closure obligations at\\nour U.S. operating facilities. We have $859,000 in commercial surety bonds dedicated for closure obligations at our Canadian operating facility. While we believe we will be able to maintain the\\nrequisite financial assurance policies at a reasonable cost, premium and collateral requirements may materially increase. Such increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\\nand results of operations. **_A change or deterioration in labor relations could disrupt our business or increase costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations._** The Company is a party to two collective bargaining agreements covering 109, or 28%, of our employees. On December 31, 2011, the\\nagreement covering 98 of our employees at our Blainville, 19 * * * Table of Contents Quebec,\\nCanada facility expired and is currently being renegotiated. In addition, the agreement covering 11 of our employees at our Richland facility is scheduled to expire in 2012.\\nWhile we believe the Company will maintain good working relations with its employees on acceptable terms, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the terms of expired or expiring\\nagreements in a manner acceptable to the Company. Therefore, potential work disruptions from labor disputes may disrupt our businesses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of\\noperations. **_Failure to perform under our contracts may adversely harm our business._** Certain contracts require us to meet specified performance criteria. Our ability to meet these criteria requires that we expend\\nsignificant resources. If we or our subcontractors are unable to perform as required, we could be subject to substantial monetary penalties and/or loss of the affected contracts which may adversely\\naffect our business. **_Failure to realize the anticipated benefits and operational performance of acquired operations could lead to an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets._** We are required to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually to determine if impairment has\\noccurred. The testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These\\nestimates can be affected by numerous factors, including potential changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in our stock\\nprice and market capitalization. Changes in these factors, or changes in actual performance compared with estimates of our future\\nperformance, may affect the fair value of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may result in an impairment charge. As a result of the Stablex acquisition, we have goodwill of\\n$21.2 million and net intangible assets of $39.2 million at December 31, 2011 that must be assessed at least annually for impairment. We\\ncannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, our financial condition and\\nresults of operations could be adversely impacted. **_Adverse economic conditions, government funding or competitive pressures affecting our customers could harm our business._** We serve oil refineries, chemical production plants, steel mills, electric utilities, real estate developers, waste brokers/aggregators\\nserving small manufacturers and other industrial customers that are, or may be, affected by changing economic conditions and competition. These customers may be significantly impacted by deterioration\\nin the general economy and may curtail waste production and/or delay spending on plant maintenance, waste clean-up projects and other discretionary work. Spending by government agencies\\nmay also be reduced due to declining tax revenues that may result from a general deterioration in economic conditions or other federal or state fiscal policy. Factors that can impact general economic\\nconditions and the level of spending by our customers include the general level of consumer and industrial spending, increases in fuel and energy costs, residential and commercial real estate and\\nmortgage market conditions, labor and healthcare costs, access to credit, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending behavior. Market forces may also compel customers to\\ncease or reduce operations, declare bankruptcy, liquidate or relocate to other countries, any of which could adversely affect our business. Our\\noperations are significantly affected by the commencement and completion of large and small clean-up projects; potential seasonal fluctuations due to weather; budgetary\\ndecisions and cash flow limitations influencing the timing of customer spending for remedial activities; the timing of regulatory agency decisions and judicial proceedings; changes in government\\nregulations and enforcement policies 20 * * * Table of Contents and\\nother factors that may delay or cause the cancellation of clean-up projects. We do not control such factors, which can cause our revenue and income to vary significantly from quarter\\nto quarter and year to year. **_Our market is highly competitive. Failure to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._** We face competition from companies with greater resources, service offerings we do not provide and lower pricing in certain instances.\\nAn increase in the number of commercial treatment or disposal facilities for hazardous or radioactive waste, significant expansion of existing competitor permitted capabilities or a decrease in the\\ntreatment or disposal fees charged by competitors could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Our business is also heavily affected by waste disposal fees imposed by government\\nagencies. These fees, which vary from state to state and are periodically adjusted, may adversely impact the competitive environment in which we conduct our business. **_Our business requires the handling of dangerous substances. Improper handling of such substances could result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of\\noperations._** We are subject to unexpected occurrences related, or unrelated, to the routine handling of dangerous substances. A fire or other\\nincident could impair one or more facilities from performing normal operations. This could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Improper handling of\\nthese substances could also violate laws and regulations resulting in fines and/or suspension of operations. **_We may not be able to obtain timely or cost effective transportation services which could adversely affect our profitability._** Revenue at each of our facilities is subject to potential risks from disruptions in rail or truck transportation services relied upon\\nto deliver waste to our facilities. Increases in fuel costs and unforeseen events such as labor disputes, public health pandemics, natural disasters and other acts of God, war or terror could prevent\\nor delay shipments and reduce both volumes and revenue. Our rail transportation service agreements with our customers generally allow us to pass on fuel surcharges assessed by the railroads. This may\\ndecrease or eliminate our exposure to fuel cost increases. Transportation services may be limited by economic conditions, including increased demand for rail or trucking services, resulting in periods\\nof slower service to the point that individual customer needs cannot be met. No assurance can be given that we can procure transportation services in a timely manner at competitive rates or pass\\nthrough fuel cost increases in all cases. Such factors could also limit our ability to achieve revenue and earnings objectives. **_We are subject to risks associated with operating in a foreign country._** On October 31, 2010, we acquired Stablex. Stablex is based in Quebec, Canada and uses the Canadian dollar as its\\nfunctional currency. Prior to this acquisition, we had very limited exposure to international risks. International operations are subject to risks that may have material adverse effects on our\\nfinancial condition and results of operations. The risks that our international operations are subject to include, among other things: \\x95\\ndifficulties and costs relating to staffing and managing foreign operations; \\x95\\nforeign labor union relations; \\x95\\nfluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar; \\x95\\nrepatriation of cash from Stablex to the United States; 21 * * * Table of Contents \\x95\\nregulatory requirements; \\x95\\nimposition of additional taxes on our foreign income; and \\x95\\nunexpected regulatory, economic and other public policy changes. **_The hazardous and radioactive waste industries in which we operate are subject to litigation risk._** The handling of radioactive, PCBs and hazardous material subjects us to potential liability claims by employees, contractors, property\\nowners, neighbors and others. There can be no assurance that our existing liability insurance is adequate to cover claims asserted against us or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in\\nthe future. Adverse rulings in legal matters could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. **_Our levels of outstanding debt and letters of credit could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to fulfill our obligations under our Credit Agreements._** As of December 31, 2011, we had $40.6 million of borrowings and $4.0 million issued in letters of credit on our\\n$95.0 million revolving line of credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with Wells Fargo National Association (\"Wells Fargo\"). This level of outstanding debt and letters of credit\\nmay: \\x95\\nadversely impact our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures,\\nacquisitions or to continue paying dividends to our stockholders; \\x95\\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of interest on our debt and fees on our\\nletters of credit, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends or other general corporate purposes; \\x95\\nsubject us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases based upon variable interest rates; \\x95\\nlimit our ability to adjust to rapidly changing market conditions, reduce our ability to withstand competitive pressures\\nand make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions of our business than competitors with less debt. If\\nwe are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and letter of credit fee obligations, we may be required to refinance all or a portion\\nof our existing debt and letter of credit facilities, or to obtain new or additional facilities. However, we may not be able to obtain such new or additional facilities on favorable terms or at all. **_Servicing our debt, including any revolving loans and capital leases, and paying our letter of credit fee obligations will require a significant amount of cash, and our\\nability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control._** Our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or interest with respect to borrowings under our Credit Agreement and to pay fee\\nobligations under our letters of credit will depend on our ability to generate cash from future operations. Our ability to generate cash depends on, among other factors, the demand for our services,\\nwhich is subject to general and industry-specific market conditions, changes in government environmental regulation, and financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors affecting our operations,\\nmany of which are beyond our control. Our operations may not generate sufficient cash flow in an amount necessary to enable us to pay our debt and the fee obligations arising from our letters of\\ncredit, or to fund our other liquidity needs. 22 * * * Table of Contents **_We may not be able or willing to pay future dividends._** Our ability to pay dividends is subject to our future financial condition and certain conditions such as continued compliance with bank\\ncovenants contained in our Credit Agreement. Our Board of Directors must also approve any dividends at their sole discretion. Pursuant to our Credit Agreement, we may only declare and pay quarterly or\\nannual dividends if on the date of declaration no event of default has occurred, no other event or condition that upon notice or continuation would constitute a default, and payment of the dividend\\nwill not result in a default.\\nUnforeseen events or situations could cause non-compliance with these bank covenants, or cause the Board of Directors to discontinue or reduce the amount of any future dividend payment. **_We may not be able to effectively adopt or adapt to new technologies._** We expect to continue implementing new technologies at our facilities to meet customer service demands and facilitate growth in our\\nbusiness. If we are unable to identify and implement new technologies in response to market conditions and customer requirements in a timely, cost effective manner, our financial condition and results\\nof operations could be adversely impacted. **_If we are unable to successfully complete the integration of future acquisitions into our business and achieve anticipated synergies in the expected time frame, our future\\nresults could be adversely affected._** Acquisitions involve multiple risks. Our inability to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business into our operations\\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business. These risks include but are not limited to: \\x95\\nchanging market conditions; \\x95\\nincreased competition; \\x95\\nlabor relations and union contracts; \\x95\\nthe need to spend substantial operational, financial and management resources integrating new businesses, technologies and\\nprocesses and related difficulties integrating them into operations, personnel or systems; \\x95\\nretention of key personnel and customers; \\x95\\nimpairments of goodwill and other intangible assets; and \\x95\\nenvironmental and other liabilities associated with past operations. **_Our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in accounting standards._** Accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (\"accounting standards\") and interpretations by various\\ngoverning bodies, including the SEC, for many aspects of our business, such as accounting for asset retirement obligations, goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes and stock-based compensation,\\nare complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation may significantly change or add significant volatility to our reported earnings without a comparable\\nunderlying change in cash flow from operations. As a result, changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. **_'"
